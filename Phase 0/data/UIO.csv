Course content
This course is divided into two parts.
Section 1

The first section will introduce you to the Norwegian education system within its Nordic context. It will provide you with a thorough understanding of all relevant components of the Norwegian education system. In addition, it will introduce you to the notion of ‘the Nordic model’, how it affects Norwegian education, as well as how it relates to the European idea and other educational models. 
The first section will cover both formal and informal institutional practices in education, and address questions about the ideas of democracy, inclusion and exclusion, the role of knowledge and expertise, the public and private dimension, lifelong learning, and access.  
Section 2

In the second section of the course the educational activities will be organized within the two specialisation areas of the program: 

Higher Education Studies (HES) 
Education and Social Change: Childhood and Youth Studies (ESCY)

This implies that the students will be divided into two groups based on the specialisation area to which they have been admitted. It will not be possible to change the area of specialisation. 
Higher Education Studies (HES)
In this area, we will move from the specific to the general by introducing students into the academic field of Higher Education Studies, the theories, concepts and terminology relevant to the study of higher education, and the basic characteristics and dynamics of higher education systems and institutions at all relevant levels. The Norwegian higher education system will be used as a frame of reference in this. Students will get acquainted with the key position of knowledge in societies around the world, and the role higher education and science play in the knowledge society. We will focus especially on higher education governance and teaching and learning aspects, and how these are related.
Education and Social Change: Childhood and Youth Studies (ESCY)
In the second specialisation area, students will first be introduced to some main theoretical perspectives on contemporary social change. Then, childhood and youth studies will be introduced and discussed from historical, social change and cross-cultural perspectives. The specialization focuses on change and continuity in key issues, perspectives and policies related to children and young people’s life and education in our contemporary world. You will examine how childhoods and youth are conceptualized in the Nordic and Norwegian socio-cultural contexts, in relation to the European and global contexts. The Nordic models of education and childhoods are compared to some other cultural perspectives and social-political models and practice related to children and youth in the world.

Course content
Course leaders: Sten Ludvigsen, Anniken Furberg, Ingvill Rasmussen
Design-based research methods (DBR) were developed in the educational sciences in the 1990s and have since been used in many fields in educational science during the last 20 years. The roots of DBR go back to experimental approaches in naturalistic context and formative interventions. One can identify two traditions in DBR:
1) DBR is seen as a hypothesis driven approach that tests variables in order to explain which features of a design can improve students’ learning outcomes in naturalistic settings.
2) DBR is used in ethnographic studies to test innovative pedagogical designs, using mainly qualitative methods to understand how students and teachers respond to the designed features in the sociocultural context.
This course will investigate the different ways in which researchers working with cognitive, socio-cognitive or socio-cultural learning perspectives use DBR as a methodological strategy to understand how and what people learn. A range of quantitative and qualitative methods, often used in combination in DBR, will be reviewed.
The course offers insight into connections between innovation, design and educational research as these have developed in DBR. Researchers, often in collaboration with computer scientists and interaction designers, work closely with practitioners to identify problems and to plan studies that address shared interests in developing new and often innovative practices. The collaborative process produces new prototypes, procedures or tools that are tested in naturalistic empirical settings (e.g., math, science, art and other subjects in schools, workplace settings, museums and science centers).
DBR is often labeled as pragmatic approach that is driven by theory and review of a field of knowledge. DBR is sometimes seen as a type of case study methodology, and this course will specifically explore the use of case studies in DBR approaches.

Ethnographic and interaction analytic methods have been widely used in educational research and are currently gaining increased importance as researchers attempt to understand educational processes across social and organizational contexts. The spread and expansion of digital technologies add to the complexity of processes of learning and work, and to the way relationships are established and maintained in space and time. Ethnographic methods, interaction analysis and virtual ethnography, especially, allow us to capture both the complexity of these processes and the way they unfold along different timescales (e.g. societal, cultural, interactional and individual).
Researching how educational phenomena such as learning, identity and competence are developed, constituted and made visible in social practices represent important research interests in the educational sciences. This course will focus on the use of ethnographic and interaction analytic methods across a variety of contexts. Ethnography and interaction analysis both focus on producing and analyzing close descriptions and observations of situated practices and their complex relations to the overall cultural frameworks within which they occur (Watson, 2013). In accordance with this approach, to analyze how people think and learn, we need to combine detailed analysis of the temporal ordering of practices with analysis of broader characteristics of historical, institutional and personal contexts.
Ethnography and interaction analysis are well suited to examine the finer details of the temporal and structural organization of social life. These methods enable us to make sense of the ways that humans and non-humans connect and together produce knowledge, practices, identities and relationships – that is the meanings and orderliness of the primary analytic objects in the educational sciences.  In the course, we will also provide students with tools to study practices in virtual spaces. Social interactions and activities situated in virtual environments represent challenges for contemporary research. Due to emerging technologies, researchers engage with different ways of collecting and working with empirical material, such as using heterogeneous data (text and audiovisual data) in their analysis. Many researchers combine analysis of what take place in front of the screen with data from digital platforms, environments and tools.

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is the preferred approach to analysing experimental intervention studies. It provides a direct test of the hypothesis under consideration (i.e. if the change in scores from baseline to post-test is larger in the intervention- compared to the control group) and increases the power in detecting intervention effects. Analysis of covariance is essentially a type of regression analysis where continuous and discrete predictors are mixed.
Many people think of regression/correlation as only applying to analyses involving continuous variables (for example height and weight). However, there are a variety of ways of coding categorical variables so that they can be used as predictors in regression models. Perhaps the simplest approach is with dummy coding in which 0,1 codes are used to represent different contrasts between pairs of groups. Dummy coding allows us to analyse data from many different designs in a flexible manner. Such coding schemes are the basis of Analysis of Covariance models.

Course content
Content
In the repertoire of quantitative methods, regression analysis is a key approach to analyzing relations between variables—moreover, it forms the basis for more advanced analytic techniques, such as structural equation modeling and multilevel analysis.
The course provides an introduction into the basic principles of regression analysis, including its assumptions, interpretation, and implementation in the statistical software package SPSS. Different regression models are introduced (e.g., multiple linear regression, logistic regression), and their application in educational and psychological contexts is illustrated.
Furthermore, participants learn how to deal with certain data issues (e.g., categorical predictors and outcomes, multicollinearity) and select appropriate regression models. Finally, the course introduces some more advanced regression techniques, such as moderation and mediation models.
The course combines lectures, data demonstrations, and practical computer exercises.

Many different techniques of test equating have been developed, and the course focuses on the versatile and powerful techniques developed within the framework of item response theory (IRT), with a special focus on  the Rasch model, and extensions of this model. The course first introduces the basic principles of IRT, including model specification, estimation of item and person parameters, and testing of model fit. Different designs of test linking and equating are then discussed from methodological and practical points of view. In the final part of the course several examples of designs for test equating are presented and discussed, and participants carry out hands-on exercises.

Course content
Since multilevel modeling has gained importance in educational and psychological research, researchers have developed a number of advanced approaches that overcome the drawbacks of traditional multilevel regression analysis. These approaches are by and large summarized within a multilevel structural equation modeling framework and provide flexible methods to address research questions that differentiate between students and classrooms, employees and companies etc. For instance, they enable school researchers to study the link between instructional variables such as teaching quality and student achievement.
In this course, we will introduce the concept of multilevel structural equation modeling and provide a number of applications from substantive areas. Among other models, we will cover doubly-latent, mediation, confirmatory factor-analytic and structural equation models. Depending on the audience, further modeling approaches might be addressed (e.g., longitudinal models). It is also intended to help students conduct their own analyses and interpret the results.
This course combines lectures and hands-on exercises, and builds up knowledge and skills in using advanced multilevel modeling techniques.

University of Oslo,UIO,Education,Computerized Adaptive Testing,3,,,[],,"
Learning outcome
The workshop intends to tackle issues encountered during the setup of a computerized adaptive test, starting from the design towards the actual delivery of a CAT.
",,,"
Course content
Why ask a person to answer a problem item, when you a priori know they won’t be able to solve it? It is a waste of time and resources, and you won’t gain any new information; this is both inefficient and ineffective.  In contrast, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is based on the principle that more information can be gained when one tailors the test towards the level of the person being tested.  Computational and statistical techniques from item response theory (IRT) and decision theory are combined to implement a test that can behave interactively during the test process and adapts towards the level of the person being tested.
The implementation of such a CAT relies on an iterative sequential algorithm that searches the pool of available items (a so-called item bank) for the optimal item to administer based on the current estimate of the person’s level (and optional external constraints). The subsequent response on this item provides new information to update the person’s proficiency estimate. This selection-responding-updating process continues until specified stop criteria have been reached.
The consequence of such an adaptive test administration is that you get an individualized tailored test that is more efficient and more effective. Because you have less of a mismatch between the level of the test and the level of the test taker, there is a lesser burden for the latter and a higher precision for the former, and this with fewer items than a traditional fixed item-set test format. Furthermore, because it is computerized and sequential, test performance can be continuously monitored and reported directly after test completion. Item response models come into play to ensure comparable scores of these individual tailored tests by putting them on the same measurement scale and to pre-calibrate the psychometric parameters of the items that are part of the item bank on which the sequential iterative algorithm operates.

Welcome to this 4 day PhD-course lead by Professor Sophia Rabe-Hesketh, University of California, Berkeley, and Professor Anders Skrondal, CEMO & Norwegian Institute of Public Health & University of California, Berkeley.
 
The short course introduces models for multilevel or clustered data, such as cross-sectional data with students nested in schools, or longitudinal data with repeated measures/panel waves nested in subjects.  Models and concepts are introduced via examples from a variety of disciplines, equations and illustrative graphs, keeping the mathematics as simple as possible (avoiding matrix algebra and calculus). However, the course covers many topics and may be conceptually demanding. Software is not discussed, but the handouts include Stata commands for all the results that are presented and the data are available online. The short course is based on successful semester-long graduate-level courses by the presenters at Berkeley and London School of Economics.

The course was postponed from autumn 2020 to spring 2021. New course dates for the lectures have been set to May 31 and June 1 + a paper workshop on September 24, 2021.
Content
Functional scientific literacy has been a long-standing focus in science educational discourses. Scientific literacy embodies students’ understanding of science content in different modes and representations, and the ability to participate in discursive practices in science proper and in tasks and situations which involve scientific knowledge and approaches.
The aim of the seminar is to provide theoretical framings and practice-relevant knowledge about the fostering of relevant, out-of-school, citizenship competencies in and through school science. The course will focus on how school science practices and discourses relevant to democratic citizenship can be studied and fostered in practice. Teaching designs that foster scientific literacy are also central themes. The seminar will focus on:

Theoretical framings of scientific literacy; which includes pragmatic (Dewey, Wittgenstein), and cultural-historical (Vygotsky, zone of proximal development) perspectives
Frameworks for developing scientific literacy in school science teaching, focusing on authenticity, multiple literacies in integrated instruction designs, and connecting everyday and specialized discourses
The design of learning environments supporting students’ development of scientific literacy with empirical examples illustrating design principles, including students’ blended talk and learning. The examples will also illustrate approaches to analysis of students’ discourses.

The course is organized by the research group COSER (Challenges of Sustainability in Educational Research) and the Department of Teacher Education and School Research, Faculty of Educational Sciences.

Be familiar with key concepts and analytical notions within the two approaches and how they may inform studies of higher education organization and practices;
Be able to identify theoretical assumptions, concepts and units of analysis in studies of higher education addressed in the course;
Be able to articulate their own research issues in relation to these traditions

",,,"
Course content
Higher education is embedded in multiple change dynamics which are related to new policy initiatives, organizational arrangements, advancements in knowledge and technologies, and shifting labour marked needs. The rapid shifts generate pressures for institutional adaptation as well as transformation of educational practices. To elucidate these change dynamics and their various implications, higher education researchers are challenged to analyse relations between organizational layers and processes that span contexts of practice.
This course focuses on two analytical approaches to studying higher education organizations and practices; deriving from institutional theory and perspectives on epistemic cultures and practices respectively. While the first strand of literature origins from sociology and political science, the latter has emerged from social studies of science and more recently from studies of other types of expert work. In recent years, they have both informed studies in higher education, and researchers have advocated a need to integrate concepts and perspectives from the two traditions.
To proceed along this line, however, a profound understanding of the two traditions is needed. The course will give an introduction to key assumptions and concepts in the two approaches, as well as to their methodological consequences. Furthermore, participants will analyse how the perspectives are used to inform empirical research presented in the course readings and in student papers.

The Learning Sciences is an interdisciplinary research field that encompasses educational psychology, social sciences, cognitive science, computer science, and other related fields of knowledge. A range of methods are used in the learning sciences, with new computational methods being developed, together these aim to capture important aspects of human learning during interactions with tools and environments that are increasingly digitalized. 
Human learning is a complex phenomenon that, in principle, involves socio-cultural, cognitive, emotional and biological aspects. Learning can take place in settings that are designed for social, cognitive, and emotional development, but it also occurs in other settings, like workplaces and during everyday activities. Technologies are involved in almost every learning activity, and currently, this often means interacting with others via digital tools, applications and infrastructures (i.e. socio-technical environments). Social interaction and collaboration is often part of such activities. The problem of defining the unit of analysis and level of description of human learning is central to understanding and explaining how, why, and where human learning take place. Given the interdependency between actions and tools, designs for learning are seen as part of learning science, and a central question to address is therefore how learning takes place under different conditions.
In this course, students will work with theoretical approaches and key concepts, methodological tools, and empirical studies of learning in the digital age. We will provide state-of-the-art descriptions of learning science today and of future trends. Ph.D. students will thus be enabled to carry out research in the learning sciences and to connect their research to emerging societal challenges.
In the course, learning and participation are perceived as interactionally constituted phenomena that emerge in practice. We will take a socio-cultural stance as one major premises. The issues addressed concern:

learning in different types of settings and how tools mediate actions and activities; 
the analytical challenge to delimit what you include in your unit of analysis;
new and emerging forms of representations and learning in the digital age;
theoretical challenges of tracing participation trajectories;
the connections and boundaries between learning practices and the institutional production and reproduction of knowledge and skills in society.

We live in a social world in which communication and everyday literacy practices have been transformed by the digital turn (Mills 2010). The changes in everyday literacy practices among young people, brought about by the miniaturisation, mobility, personalisation and ubiquitous use of digital technologies, are profound. Recent research show how digital media are central to young people’s everyday interactions with the world, and suggest a sea change in the way that they experience their literacy lives in contrast with previous generations. In line with sociocultural perspectives on literacy as social practice (Street 1994; Gee 1996), this course will adopt the plural form ‘multi-literacies’ (New London Group, 1996) in recognition of the diversity of contemporary digital literacy practices that young people take part in, and also the plurality of ways that this concept has been interpreted in academic accounts. 
During the last two decades, the term ‘digital literacy’ has become a key term in ways of understanding cultural transformations of literacy practices due to the growth of digital technologies. Within broader conceptions of the interrelationship between culture and mind, it is important to study and understand the practices of reading and writing that young people are involved in across different domains and contexts. As a field of research, studies of ‘multi-literacies’, ‘digital literacies’ and ‘multi-modality’ draw on diverse perspectives and methodological approaches often with a common focus on literacy practices as deeply enmeshed within cultural contexts and resources (Street 2001). The areas of interest therefore extend beyond formal teaching environments, and include the vernacular practices that typify people’s everyday literacy lives. 
Given that the ability to be digitally literate will have a profound impact on all young people’s futures (International Reading Association 2001), a core aim of this course will be to explore important contributions to the development of robust theoretical, methodological and analytic frameworks to: 

underpin interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary research into young people’s digital and multimodal literacy practices at home, in educational settings and in the wider community; 
understand how young people develop ‘emergent digital literacy’ (Marsh 2015) in homes, schools and communities, and how they use digital devices for pleasure, learning, creating and communicating (Chaudron, Di Gioia, and Gemo 2018);
identify and explore the affordances of digital devices and media as literacy tools and socially-negotiated sites that can promote young people’s operational, creative and critically reflective literacy practices. 

In this course, students will be introduced to theoretical concepts, methodological tools and empirical studies of emerging literacies and learning in the digital age. Through this, PhD students will be enabled to carry out research on emerging digital literacies, and connect their research to emerging societal trends. In the course, learning and literacy are perceived as interactionally constituted phenomena that emerge in practice. As such, the course is related to the course UV9416 - Learning science research in the digital age.

Can we really mix methods in social science research and evaluation? If so, what does it look like? How can it be done? If not. Why? In this PhD course we will explore these and other questions. The aim is for all of us to better understand mixed methods research in social science research and evaluation. We will explore if mixed methods are really a third paradigm of research or if these methods are simply a presentation (or use) of the two dominant (qualitative and qualitative) research paradigms in one space.
More specifically, within this course we hope to provide an overview of mixed methods research, consisting of the history and philosophy of mixed methods, emerging literature within the field, purposes and characteristics of mixed methods research, types of research problems typically addressed, the specification of mixed methods purpose statements and research questions and types of major mixed methods designs. A large emphasis of this course we will focus on the “why” in addition to the “how”, and we will discuss mixed methods designs and how they are used in social science research.
At the completion of the course, the participants should be able to thoughtfully discuss why or why not mixed methods should be considered its own research paradigm. And if it should, how can it help inform your PhD project?
The PhD course combines lectures, presentations and plenary discussions. It is a basic building block towards finalizing a mixed methods article and/or PhD thesis.
Work format: Lectures and presentations.

International expert
The international expert is Suresh Canagarajah, who is the Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of English, Applied Linguistics, and Asian Studies, and Director of the Migration Studies Project at Pennsylvania State University. He teaches courses in World Englishes, Multilingual Writing, Language Socialization, Rhetoric/Composition, and Postcolonial Studies in the departments of English and Applied Linguistics. Suresh comes from the Tamil-speaking northern region of Sri Lanka. He taught earlier at the University of Jaffna, Sri Lanka, and the City University of New York. He was formerly the editor of the TESOL Quarterly and President of the American Association of Applied Linguistics.
Suresh has adopted research approaches such as ethnography, discourse analysis, narrative study, and teacher research to study multilingualism in education. His early studies adopted critical ethnography to address the strategies of resistance and appropriation by Sri Lankan students and teachers in the face of western teaching materials and methods, and the global power of English. His book which brings together such studies, Resisting Linguistic Imperialism in English Teaching (OUP, 1999) won the Mina Shaughnessy Award from the Modern Language Association of America (MLA), and was short listed by the British Association of Applied Linguistics (BAAL).
Adopting autoethnographic methods, he later analyzed the challenges in academic writing for fellow Sri Lankan scholars and the resulting inequalities in academic publishing in his book Geopolitics of Academic Writing (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2002). He situates academic writing in the broader economic conditions, communicative traditions, and intellectual culture of local and international settings to develop a decolonial orientation to literacy and writing. This book won the Olson Award from the Teachers of Advanced Composition. The insights from this research orientation inform his book for teachers of writing titled Critical Academic Writing and Multilingual Students (University of Michigan Press, 2002). This book adopts a critical pedagogical orientation to the teaching of English writing for multilingual students, and has been widely used in classrooms.
Suresh later adopted the theoretical orientation of translingualism to study how communicative practices go beyond labelled and autonomous languages. This led to a series of classroom ethnographies and teacher research in the courses he taught in the United States for the teacher development of composition instructors.  This research led to analysing the ways writers bring together diverse semiotic resources in their writing, and pedagogies for making spaces for such creativity in classrooms. This research also led Suresh to argue that translingualism called for a more collaborative literacy where readers and writers constantly negotiated their reading/writing practices for the emergence of meanings. He labelled this negotiated literacy, countering the dominant paradigms of autonomous and social literacies. These studies are brought together in his publication Translingual Practice: Global Englishes and Cosmopolitan Relations (Routledge, 2013), which won best book awards from the professional organizations American Association of Applied Linguistics, British Association of Applied Linguistics (BAAL), and the Modern Language Association of America (MLA).
Presently, Suresh has expanded his notion of translingualism to accommodate diverse semiotic repertoires and ecological resources in literacy and communication, along a New Materialist theoretical orientation. He has adopted multi-sited ethnographies of international science scholars in the United States to analyse the ways they engage in rhizomatic meaning construction and distributed social practices. His 2018 publications in journals such as the Modern Language Journal and Applied Linguistics demonstrate how the orientation to text can be broadened to situate them in broader communicative ecologies to explain textual emergence. These perspectives influence his latest book Transnational Literacy Autobiographies as Translingual Writing (Routledge, 2020).

Course content
Spring 2021: new dates have been set to May 19-21. More information about the schedule can be found on the current semester site (link above) and on Canvas.
Although multilingualism is a centuries-old phenomenon, the value of multilingualism and multilingual literacies in educational settings keeps attracting scholarly interest and engendering public debate. Research during the past decades has provided us with detailed accounts of the non-linear dimensions of the development of multilingual literacies, as well as the complex connections between transnational processes, social practices and the social identities of multilingual learners. At the same time, the field continues to struggle with the pedagogical challenges that arise when attempts are made to support and foster multilingualism in educational policies and classrooms.  
This course is to examine several theoretical and methodological approaches that are commonly used in this domain, and guide candidates in collaborative data analysis. The course will comprise lectures and collaborative data analysis sessions, the latter drawing on data provided by the facilitators and participating PhD candidates. Course credit will be granted on the basis of participation in lectures, group analysis sessions, and individual data presentations.

Course content
Eye tracking technology is becoming increasingly affordable and technically accessible, and offers unprecedented detail into the study of mental processes at the core of educational and psychological research. More and more researchers realize that incorporation of eye tracking in their research methods arsenal boosts their research productivity and efficiency in uncovering the mechanisms underlying learning and skilled performance. This training workshop is designed to allow researchers with no prior experience to learn enough about this technology, understand the opportunities and challenges involved, and to familiarize themselves in hands-on sessions, so that they will be competent (and feel confident) enough to incorporate this method in their own research, either independently or as part of a research group.
The content of the course is structured as follows:
An introductory background will be provided in Day 1, concerning eye tracking technology, including equipment and data.
Days 2–4 will expand from the introductory foundation to provide concrete training in topics of high relevance for educational and psychological research. Lectures will be given by internationally recognized experts in eye tracking, covering an advanced topic from a theoretical point of view and presenting concrete research examples, pointing out challenges and solutions.
Two supervised hands-on sessions each day will provide opportunity for familiarization with the procedures and interaction with experienced researchers to address practical issues.
Day 5 will be devoted to (supervised) hands-on work by the attendees, working in groups on entire mini-studies, from conception to presentation, including data collection and preliminary analysis. Doctoral students taking the course for credit will be required to conduct further work on their mini-study, including complete data processing and analysis, as well as writing up and submitting a full research report with conclusions and limitations.
The workshop is supported and co-organized by the Department of Special Needs Education, the research group Literacy and Numeracry (LiNCon), and the Oslo Assessment, Internvention, and Learning Lab at the Faculty of Educational Sciences, with additional support by SR Research Ltd., and is co-funded by the Norwegian Research Council through IT events support (arrangement støtte innenfor IKT project number 310348).

Responsible: Berit Karseth and Bernadette Hörmann
Guest professors: Stefan Hopmann, University of Vienna, and Ninni Wahlström, Linnaeus University
State-run curriculum making has for many decades been considered as a place-based endeavour that brings together state authorities and various stakeholders to reach agreement about the aims and the content of public schooling. To accomplish Bildung for all and provide education for future generations, these initiatives result in shared norms and conceptions of what good education is about. They also pursue a democratic mandate that allows for pedagogical freedom in educational practices.
In the course of increasing influence of global education discourses on national policy making processes, curricula have changed their character towards competence and performance-oriented descriptions of content. Even if this process of change has been going on in many countries all over the world, research shows that global discourses have not led to an alignment of national responsibilities and global expectations respectively, but rather to a variation in how nation states have adopted international ideas and reshaped the configuration of curriculum components within their contexts.
The seminar poses the question to what extent places where curricula are made still matter for the way national curricula are formulated and enacted. It focuses on the theory and history of curricula and curriculum practice in the light of national traditions and global education discourses. In what respects have global education discourses changed the societal mandate and pedagogical virtue of curricula? How has the entanglement of transnational and national curriculum policies changed teacher agency and the actual priorities in teaching? How can we theoretically understand curricula both from today and before, and what implications do the different approaches have for the education of tomorrow’s generation? 
The questions are addressed within lectures, panel and group discussions, and reading material that examines recent developments and curriculum theorizing within a historical and international comparative perspective.

Responsible: Kirsten Sivesind and Chanwoong Baek
Guest lecturers: Gil Eyal, Columbia University, USA, and Jaakko Kauko, Tampere University, Finland
This doctoral seminar explores knowledge utilization and transfer across geographical, institutional, and systematic boundaries. In education, policymakers increasingly borrow education policies from another country; a greater number of scientific experts are invited to the education policy process to legitimize the proposed changes as “evidence-based”; teachers, students, and parents fight to be accepted as legitimate policy actors with credible knowledge; and policymakers, academics, and practitioners call for collaboration to close the gap between research and practice. This seminar aims to help participants review, apply, and critically reflect on relevant theories and methods to understand and analyze these phenomena of knowledge utilization and transfer in education.
The seminar mainly consists of two types of activities. The first is devoted to lectures on theories, methods, existing literature, and current issues that help us understand, investigate, and explain how knowledge is utilized and transfers across countries, institutions, and systems. The second includes group sessions in which participants present and discuss their projects, applying the topics covered in the lectures.
Prior to the seminar, each participant will submit one-page summary/proposal of their research interest or project related to the topic of knowledge utilization and transfer. Participants will have an opportunity to share their projects and receive feedback from peers and the instructors during the discussion sessions.

Classical texts, images, and ideas have played and still play an important role in modern ideologies (understood as the sets of normative ideas that groups of people have, or are supposed to have, about various aspects of society, from art to economy). Antiquity has been appealed to and has been contested as a point of reference from very different, sometimes opposing, ideologies, and it pops up where we would least expect it. In this course, we read and study a corpus of diverse texts such as literary works, historical documents, and scholarship. These are made to illuminate, from various critical perspectives, the relevance of classical references in the articulation of some of the ideologies that have co-defined European cultural history (e.g., in fascism, feminism, and modernism). Our methodological starting point is discourse analysis.

have developed a fuller understanding of current debates on the notion of heritage and their implications for the study of premodern cultures;
have become familiar with some key heritage sites in Rome as well as the historical and conceptual questions they raise;
be able to meaningfully relate your case study both to larger historical and conceptual questions regarding heritage and to other cases presented at the workshop;
have engaged with material and scholarship across a range of disciplines relevant to questions of heritage.

",,,"
Course content
Heritage is often understood as a modern notion. Its origins are commonly believed to lie in the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and in national (if not nationalist) agendas. Even the ever-growing interest in local, indigenous, and dissonant heritages in the fields of Heritage Studies and the Social Sciences have largely been restricted to (recent) modernity.
This PhD/MA workshop explores how modern notions of ‘heritage’ can be applied to the study of premodern societies and their views on cultural preservation and transmission. In particular, we would like to address the following sets of questions:

How can concepts and insights from modern Heritage Studies be applied to the study of premodern societies? And, vice versa, how can a longer historical analysis contribute to a better understanding of modern heritage? What are the dangers of anachronism? And how can these be tackled?
How has the modern notion of ‘heritage’ developed? How is it rooted in earlier ideas about the engagement with significant objects, texts, and languages from the remote past? How and why did ‘heritage’ emerge as the dominant concept?
What alternative concepts and metaphors do we have to think and talk about heritage? For example: legacy, afterlife, survival, tradition. How do they work, and what are their conceptual gains and losses for understanding premodern heritage phenomena?

The course consists of a three-day workshop in Rome and preparatory work in advance. Rome is an excellent place to interrogate both modern and premodern notions of heritage as it is the focal point of various forms of heritage, from ‘local’ to ‘universal’, from material to immaterial, from antiquity to the present day.

The term Anthropocene describes the most recent, hotly debated epoch in Earth's history: a time in which humans have radically altered the planet's climate and ecosystems.
In this annual lecture series, invited lecturers from around the world and across a range of disciplines—biology, earth system science, history, anthropology, geography, philosophy, law—draw on their own research to interrogate and respond to this epochal concept, exploring its relationship to the planetary crisis and engaging students in the prospect of far-reaching environmental and socio-political transformations.

Discomedusa. Ernst Haeckel's Kunstformen der Natur (1904)

Over the course of five seminars, this course introduces you to the dynamic and rapidly evolving field of environmental humanities through close readings of selected texts that highlight both established and developing topics within the field. The course is curated by active researchers: each year the selection of readings shifts, reflecting their focus and interests.

For Autumn 2022, the course explores topics that range from the ironies of pop-cultural green engagement to the politics of energy imaginaries and the affects of climate change visualization. The selected readings include texts about oft-quoted and well-travelled concepts like ‘Dark Ecology,’ as well as more recent writing on the cultural power of energy regimes and infrastructures. The readings are also chosen especially because they offer tools and methods that cultivate an increased sense of self-reflexivity and critical awareness about the tropes and biases of much environmental discourse. For example, we will ask ourselves what it means to be petrosubjects in an intimate relationship with oil; and how our attachments to the environment interact with aspects of gender, sexuality, race and class. We will also learn to identify and deconstruct common tropes and cultural registers that permeate environmentalist discourse and that keep exclusionary biases and boundaries in place; tropes like proximity, immediacy, and reproductive futurism. In addition, the course exposes students to environmental humanities scholarship about different media formats, allowing them to develop a broader media-literacy.

Course content
This is a broad-based survey course which gives an introduction to British history, culture and present-day British society. It has two main components, one historical and one contemporary. The historical part of the course charts the development of the British Isles from 1066 up to the end of World War 2, with a main focus on political history. The contemporary part focuses on the emergence of the modern British state and modern British society after 1945, as well as central institutions in present-day Britain.
A main theme in the course as a whole is the relationship between the four “historic nations” of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, past and present. We study this relationship both with respect to the gradual unification of the four nations into one British state, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; the subsequent division of this state into the UK and the Republic of Ireland; and the many and varied challenges facing the British state and British society today. In the contemporary part of the course we look at the UK after the partition of Ireland, which means Great Britain and Northern Ireland (not the Republic of Ireland).
The course provides students with a foundation for further studies of the British Isles as an area.

Discover the force of an old Germanic language! This course takes you to the period from the Viking incursions c. year 800 to the Norman conquest of Britain in 1066. You will learn the basics of English as it was then – a very different language from what it is now. We will study the morphological and syntactic structure of the language, and you will learn to read, translate and pronounce a variety of texts. Language does not exist independently of people and events, and the relation between language and history was especially close in this period. Hence, the course also includes a historical part (20%), in which we focus on the consequences of historical events on the status and development of the English language.
This is a course that requires systematic and diligent study throughout the term, but it gives you access to a very interesting linguistic and historical period. Through studying an older stage of the language, you will also be able to view modern English in a new light.

Linguistics is the study of the structure of language and how language is used. Literature involves the use of language, sometimes in ways that push language to its limits.
This course explores ways that theoretical tools from linguistics can be applied to understand how literary texts are interpreted, and, conversely, ways in which literary texts provide interesting data and problems for theories of language and its use.
The course includes discussion of the following:

How literary texts and their interpretations compare with other kinds of language use
The open-ended nature of literary texts and the active role of the reader
Figurative speech, such as metaphor and irony

After completing the course, you will be able to

explain the structure of English words
account for the history of the English vocabulary

",,,"
Course content
The course consists of four parts: word formation (morphology), the history of English words, the meaning of words, and lexicography, i.e. the principles of dictionary creation. In the first part of the course we study English morphology, that is the structure of words. A word is typically made up of a root, to which may be added various affixes (prefixes and suffixes) to create new words. The focus of the second part of the course is the origin of words in English. English is an unusual language in the sense that it has a particularly large number of loanwords from other languages, which is due to historical events. We therefore look at where English words come from and how native English words and word elements have merged in the history of English. In the third part of the course we consider the meaning of words, and the meaning relations words enter into, for example synonymy, hyponymy, collocations. The part about lexicography will be spread out over the term. In connection with all the other topics, we look at dictionaries and the way that lexicographers have to take morphology, history and meaning into consideration when constructing dictionary entries.

The first half of the 20th century was a turbulent and transformative period for American and British culture.  Women and men began to define themselves in very different ways, and one of the tools they used to redefine themselves was literature. 
The novels, short stories, and poetry of the early 20th century critiqued existing forms of identity, suggested new alternative forms, and provided readers with a space in which to reflect on the ways in which they might transform themselves and their surroundings. 
This course will explore some of the forms American and British literature took during the first half of the 20th century, and it will consider the continuing relevance of these texts to our contemporary situation.

Course content
Although literature and film are different forms of media, operating in dissimilar ways and producing various kinds of artistic effects, they are both narrative forms of communication. Both kinds of texts can be explored as not only reflecting but also producing and sometimes resisting the cultures from which they come. Fictional texts that have been adapted into films can be productive sites for analyzing discourses related to race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, disability, species, and environment at particular historical and cultural moments. This course explores these kinds of issues in the context of cultural studies and critical theory, while also paying attention to genre conventions and elements of narrative form.

A main aim of the course is to train the students in the historical approach, assessing relationships of cause-and-effect in the past, and the question of change versus continuity. Independently of which of the three centuries we address, therefore, we ask ourselves the overall question: to what extent was the British society that emerged at the end of the century a different one from that of a hundred years before? The course will offer a combination of general history within the period covered, and focus on a theme of particular relevance to the century under investigation. Both the century addressed, and the specific theme emphasised, may therefore vary with each offering of the course.

Course content
The term ""green tradition"" was coined in the 1970s by a prominent literary scholar. It refers to a body of American writing, criticism, architecture and painting that reflects on the interaction of nature, landscape and society. These texts from the 19th and 20th centuries provide the content of this course. We will examine their intrinsic value for reflection on the human condition, but also evaluate their potential usefulness in light of current environmental issues, which have become predominant concerns of our time.
It has now been 50 years since the celebration of the first Earth Day in the US and nearly 37 years since the founding of Die Grünen in Germany. Environmentalism has gone from a fringe idea to a global agenda. It has appropriated the term “green” by setting forth a highly politicized agenda focused on global climate change and income redistribution. Solutions are relentlessly high tech: hyper-urbanism, artificial agriculture, and “smart” technologies are  presented as the only feasible responses to the global environmental crisis. The course will examine the American “green tradition” as a potential alternative or corrective to these developments.

Course content
The belief that the United States is unique and uniquely blessed – a land of freedom that all other countries seek to emulate -- is central to popular constructions of American nationality. This ideology, known as American Exceptionalism, is essential for understanding American history, politics, and foreign policy. Communities demand that American History teachers and textbooks support this ideology wholeheartedly and without question. Politicians who question this belief in the slightest put their careers at risk. Despite the popularity of Exceptionalism, there are many challenges to the ideology.
This course will study the origins, practices, and results of the ideology of American Exceptionalism. We will consider both aspects that support the notion and aspects that challenge it. The class will examine several distinct aspects/events of American history from this perspective. We will look at how popular culture supports this ideology. We will examine debates over history curriculum for different educational levels and discuss the goals that affect the teaching of national history to various age/grade levels.

",,,"
Course content

What makes us perceive texts as coherent?
And what is the difference between a text and an arbitrary collection of sentences?

The answer given in systemic-functional linguistics is that texts have texture, i.e. they have cohesion, thematic structure, and information structure. All these features are signalled in a text through lexical and grammatical choices.
This course focuses on how texts are structured and how texture is recognized on the basis of lexicogrammatical features. The course also gives some attention to genre variation. The main theoretical framework is systemic-functional grammar, but other approaches are also discussed. In addition, practical text analysis is an important part of the course.

This course explores the most important theories that have been proposed, and shows how they are increasingly being tested in experimental and developmental work.
The topics covered include

the distinction between sentence and utterance meaning
the distinction between explicit and implicit meaning
pragmatic principles
the development of pragmatic abilities in children

In the second half of the course we look in depth at how the theory provides insight into one area of language use: for example we might look at figurative use, including metaphor and irony; or at polysemy and lexical modulation.

The course gives an introduction to discourse analysis, a discipline that examines patterns of language across texts and the functions of texts in their social and cultural contexts. The emphasis is on how various types of text resemble or differ from each other in terms of vocabulary, grammar, cohesion and stylistic features. The coursework involves the analysis of concrete texts, with special focus on conversational speech and literary, journalistic and academic writing. An important aim is to increase your awareness of linguistic and stylistic features of text types and the reasons for the variation between them. Such an awareness will be useful in further work with text, for example in writing, reading, editing and teaching.

You will learn the basics of English as it was then – a very different language from what it is now. We will study the morphological and syntactic structure of the language, and you will learn to read, translate and pronounce a variety of texts. Language does not exist independently of people and events, and the relation between language and history was especially close in this period. Hence, the course also includes a historical part (20%), in which we focus on the consequences of historical events on the status and development of the English language.
This is a course that requires systematic and diligent study throughout the term, but it gives you access to a very interesting linguistic and historical period. Through studying an older stage of the language, you will also be able to view modern English in a new light.

Linguistics is the study of the structure of language and how language is used. Literature involves the use of language, sometimes in ways that push language to its limits.
This course explores ways that theoretical tools from linguistics can be applied to understand  how literary texts are interpreted, and, conversely, ways in which literary texts provide interesting data and problems for theories of language and its use.
Key questions for this course include:
Are literary texts and their interpretations significantly different from other kinds of language use, and if so how?
Can linguistic theories explain the open-ended nature of literary texts and the active role of the reader?

Prerequisites
Formal prerequisite knowledge
Admission to the master program in European Languages, LeP or other suitable master programs.
",,"
Learning outcome
One significant aim of the course is to acquire knowledge about the studied texts and about an important and popular literary genre. A related aim is to develop the student's ability to analyse and discuss travel narratives in the light of, and aided by, relevant theory.
",,,"
Course content
Travel writing is an engaging and expanding field of study. This course will discuss a selection of fictional and non-fictional texts which can all be subsumed under the broad category of 'travel literature'. Focusing on narrative technique, structure, thematics, and generic variants and characteristics, the course will consider a number of travel narratives from the eighteenth century onwards. Paying attention to elements of history and context, the course is text-oriented. Since the issue of narrative looms large in travel writing, and since travel is a key concept in postcolonial studies, references will be made to narrative theory as well as postcolonial theory.

University of Oslo,UIO,Humanities,The Auto-Graphic Novel,10,,,[],,"
Learning outcome
After completing this course you have:

developed a vocabulary for discussing the relationship between texts and images
learned how to analyze graphic novels as a way to think about current events and debates
learned how to understand some of the ways that artists and writers use their lives and work to transform both personal and collective memory

",,,"
Course content
The graphic novel is a relatively recent phenomenon, a genre that draws simultaneously on contemporary visual culture and narrative methods. Some of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of recent memory are also autobiographical, telling a personal story of survival in the face of personal and/ or collective trauma.
The graphic novels in this course are all autobiographical, personal expressions of the artist confronting death, revolution, and/ or war, and they all depict the ways that the individual both shapes and is shaped by history.
With this as background, in this course we will study the graphic novel as a unique literary form, and discuss questions such as:

What does the graphic novel do that other genres cannot?
In what ways it is a useful vehicle for autobiography?
How do these text construct an ethics of encountering “the other”?

Learning outcome
After completing this course, you:

will have an understanding of the 20th century American novel, particularly in its modernist and postmodern forms,
will have a working knowledge of textual analysis and its importance,
will understand the close relationship between literary form and social form,
will be familiar with post-structuralist and Marxist approaches to literary criticism.

",,,"
Course content
Time and money are two of the main forces that shape human ends. Our conception of time has a profound impact on how we understand ourselves, and on how we draw the boundary between the possible and the unreasonable. In a similar fashion, our collective understanding of money exerts a sharp influence on how we order our personal and communal lives. 
This course will examine these two forces through the lens of literature. It will use the reading and analysis of a select group of American novels as a way of interrogating the links between time, money, and literature.
In this course, we will examine the ways in which novels work to naturalize or challenge social conceptions of time and money. More importantly, we will consider all the ways in which the reading of novels helps us reflect on the nature of time and money, and we will think about the way these reflections are connected to issues of race, sexuality, subjectivity, and community.

After completing this course, you:

can outline the themes, structures, and development of the gay novel in English.
can analyze narrative technique in the novel and how it shapes the perception of reality, particularly the representation of gender and sexuality.
have an understanding of how homosexuality was perceived in one or more parts of the English-speaking world in recent history.
have advanced skills in scholarly writing in English.

",,,"
Course content
This course will provide an introduction to the gay novel in English in the 20th and early 21st centuries. As a starting point, “gay” is understood to mean “gay male” and “novel” is understood to be any fictional, narrative text that has been published separately as a book. In this course, though, we do not presume to know what a “gay novel” is before we have explored what it has been and may yet become.
We will explore this being and becoming in a variety of ethnic and racial, historical and cultural, gendered and class-inflected, sexual and affective settings and situations. Our understanding of the themes, structures, and development of the novels will also be informed by narrative theory. The course may concentrate on one specific author or period or contain a selection of authors from one or several periods.

will have advanced skills in scholarly writing in English

",,,"
Course content
This course offers a thorough grounding in the field of children's and young adult (YA) literature, showcasing the diversity and innovation of this rapidly growing branch of literary study. We will grapple with some of the basic theoretical questions that underpin our understanding of children’s and YA literature: what is a ‘children’s book’? How do we know whether a book is for children or adults? Can we clearly distinguish between children and adults as readers? What do we mean by the figure of ‘the child’, and what is at stake when we consider this figure in literature? How have society’s notions of ‘the child’ changed across time and cultures? Drawing on seminal theoretical work in the field, we build up the skills and analytical toolkit to examine children’s literature in a nuanced and sophisticated way. We will explore the ways in which study of children’s literature can productively intersect with a number of other literary critical approaches – feminism, ecocriticism, postcolonial theory, among others – by focusing on a series of important children’s/YA novels, spanning the nineteenth century (often regarded as a ‘Golden Age’ of children’s literature) to the present day. Students will explore how asking questions about children in literary texts opens up significant debates about culture, sexuality, gender, the environment, and much more.

University of Oslo,UIO,Humanities,Ethics in Contemporary British Fiction,10,,,[],,"
Learning outcome
After completing this course, you:

Understand how literary values are presented in narrative fiction
Can identify and respond to ethical questions asked in, and by, a novel
Have improved your knowledge of key novels written by some of the most influential and widely discussed contemporary British novelists
Understand better how novels can contribute to the production of history and culture

",,,"
Course content
This course will explore how values are presented in a range of contemporary British novels. The word “ethics” in the course title is here closely linked to “values” (in the plural): ethics indicates the values aesthetically presented in narrative fiction. These values may be different both in kind and scope, thus often creating tensions or conflicts typically related to, and expressed through, the varying views, actions, and attitudes of the texts’ characters and narrators.
Ethics is in this course closely linked to, and considered as inseparable from, aesthetics. Ethics also includes the reader’s ethics, which necessarily influences the act of reading. At the same time, the narrative ethics of a novel or short story can challenge, and possibly even influence, the reader’s ethics: This interplay will be discussed and explored by the course participants. Ethics in literature tends to assume the form of questions – questions asked by the author via the different agents of a written narrative, and questions asked by the reader about the written narrative.
That such questions can reveal how limited our perspective is, thus improving our understanding of other human beings’ perspectives and values, is demonstrated by the novels read and discussed in the course. Illustrative of, and continuing, the strong ethical strand in British fiction from Jane Austen onwards, the novels explored in the course show that ethical questions are also asked by contemporary British authors.

We will:

look at literary representations of racial violence in texts ranging from the 19th to the 21st Century
consider the different ways in which race and violence are represented in literary texts
examine the ways in which these representations function as symbols, metaphors, or symptoms of the American condition, both in the past and the present

The readings will include both literary texts, and theoretical considerations of the way in which race and racial violence shape both the American imagination and the social landscape.  Our readings and our discussions will keep one eye on the contemporary state of affairs in the United States, and we will conclude the semester with readings focused on the eruptions of racial violence taking place over the last year and a half.

Have acquired knowledge of the narrative form and thematic concerns of some of the most significant narratives written by Joseph Conrad and W. G. Sebald
Understand how important aspects of the two authors’ biographies and writings are linked to each other
Can identify and respond to ethical questions asked in, and by, the narratives under consideration
Have improved your knowledge of key texts written by two of the most influential and widely discussed British writers of their generations
Understand better how narratives can contribute to the production of history and culture

",,,"
Course content
This course will explore a selection of narratives written by two of the most original authors of their generations. A key figure in British and European modernism, Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) has over the last couple of decades become a major reference in postcolonial and cultural studies. Frequently described as late modern, the narratives of W. G. Sebald (1944-2001) are widely recognized as significant contributions not only to contemporary British and European literature, but also to other artistic forms such as photography and film, and to variants of non-fiction such as testimony and travel writing.
Exploring the narrative strategies of Conrad and Sebald, the seminar will pay particular attention to problems and artistic features linked to, and forged through, questions of exile, identity, distance, empathy, memory, loss, violence, solidarity, and uses and abuses of power. The seminar starts from the premiss that the aesthetics and ethics of Conrad and Sebald’s narratives are closely linked. The word “ethics” is here closely linked to “values” (in the plural): ethics indicates the values aesthetically presented in Conrad and Sebald’s narratives. These values may be different both in kind and scope, thus often creating tensions or conflicts related to, and expressed through, the varying views, actions and attitudes of the texts’ characters and narrators. In the narratives of Conrad and Sebald, ethics tends to assume the form of questions – questions asked by the author via the different agents of a written narrative, and questions asked by the reader about the written narrative. That such questions can reveal how limited our perspective is, thus potentially improving our understanding of other human beings’ perspectives and values, is demonstrated by the narratives read and discussed in the seminar.

",,,"
Course content
Today, traditional verse forms such as couplets, the sonnet, ode, and elegy are joined by newer idioms such as dub poetry and rap. Poetry of all kinds is enjoying a burgeoning of interest and involvement all over the English-speaking world. Poetry is the form of writing that most deliberately cultivates and harnesses the resources of traditional form and collective memory. It is also the literary form people seek when they attend to trauma and disorientation, to the imperatives of celebration and commemoration, and the need to bear witness to the life of the passions and the mind. This course seeks to analyze the ways in which poetry functions, focusing on a syllabus of primary as well as secondary works that will vary from term to term, reflecting the expertise and interests of the convener. Two aims will remain constant: to grasp how poems are achieved through the manipulation of form, and to understand how they reach out to be interpreted in relevant contexts, whether formal, material, historical, social, political, or biographical. The rhetorical purpose of poems will be considered, and students will be encouraged to investigate the documentary evidence of poetry’s impact and reception. The course aims to enable students to master the formal and contextual analysis of poems, and to make serious and sensitive contributions to the academic study of poetry.

",,,"
Course content
Books and writings claiming to portray real lives and life experiences are a recently growing trend. The writers “tell all” in autobiographies and memoirs, letters, diaries or essays, or on social media. The genre of life writing can also include poems and narratives that evolve into autobiographical fiction, or biographical narratives not written in the first person. How has this rich and varied genre evolved historically and why is it still so popular today? Which theories and perspectives can help us understand the phenomenon of life writing? In this course, we will examine a range of texts written in English, focusing on how they are written and how they matter.
Portraying a life or telling one’s story can take many different forms, from commercial branding and cultivation of stereotypes to a radical challenging of societal norms and expectations. The question of who gets their story told opens up to discussions of cultural identity and representation. Experimental life writing is related to art, politics, and philosophy, defined by Theodor W. Adorno in the 1960s as the liberating “smashing of the façade of life in which one happens to find oneself.”

Course content
As one literary critic puts it, we live in an age of human rights, meaning that here in the West the narratives and images of human rights have become a part of daily life.
Human rights are represented in various forms in all branches of the media, in street campaigns, and on bookshelves. Yet, rarely do we stop and think about what human rights are, how they are narrated here in the affluent West, how they structure our ways of thinking and seeing ourselves and others.
This seminar is designed to investigate these issues and more, and in order to do so we will read a wide array of texts-historical, theoretical, fictional, autobiographical, and visual-that will help us to examine the discourses of human rights representation in detail and from a variety of angles.

Course content

What can illness narratives tell us about both individual experiences and broader cultural contexts in the U.S.?
How can critical attention to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, disability, species, and environment illuminate contemporary texts that both reflect and produce various ways of thinking about illness and disability?
How can illness narratives, broadly conceived, be studied in relation to theories and histories of biopolitics?
How can terminal and chronic illnesses be linked with what might be called terminal injustice, in which oppressions related to race, class, gender, sexuality, species, and environment sometimes seem impossible to overcome?

This course will explore these questions and more in relation to theories of biopolitics, posthumanism, animality studies, disability studies, and American studies, while also focusing on key memoirs, novels, plays, films, and other cultural texts. Our primary goal will be to use readings, class discussions, and critical writing assignments to explore the cultural politics and implications of illness narratives in contemporary U.S. culture.

Course content
What kind of beast might be lurking inside you, barely kept in check by your self-control?
What kinds of instincts and capabilities do various nonhuman animals have?
How have various thinkers and texts tried to distinguish between what it means to be human as opposed to animal?
How can representations and constructions of animals and human animality in American literary and cultural texts affect the way we think about relationships with different kinds of animals?
How has the way we have thought about animality at different historical and cultural moments helped to construct (and sometimes resist) problematic ideas about issues such as ""natural"" behavior, competition, sexuality, differences between races and genders, and exploitation of various kinds?
From an interdisciplinary perspective, this course will explore the nature of “the beast” in U.S. literature and culture.
Engaging with debates from the academic fields of human-animal studies, posthumanist theory, animality studies, and ecocriticism, we will explore issues such as evolutionary theories used to explain human and nonhuman behavior, different ways of thinking about human/animal difference, and the historical relationship between discourses of animality and the construction of human categories such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, disability, and class in specific situated contexts.

",,,"
Course content
In this course we study the development of Scottish politics from the opening of the devolved institutions – the Scottish Parliament and Executive – in 1999 to the present. We assess the impact this new political arena has had on the political parties, on the political landscape and on the conduct of politics in Scotland in general, asking the question: Has the anticipated ‘new politics’, centred on a consensus-oriented model materialised, or is Scottish politics still dominated by the British adversarial tradition? The course also addresses the development of the devolved institutions themselves, and looks at the rise of the Scottish National Party (SNP) to become the dominant political party in Scotland.
Particular emphasis is placed on the question of Scottish independence, the SNP’s argument for independence – including its references to Nordic ‘model countries’ – and on the independence referendum which was held in 2014.

Course content
The term ""green tradition"" was coined in the 1970s by a prominent literary scholar. It refers to a body of American writing, criticism, architecture and painting that reflects on the interaction of nature, landscape and society. These texts from the 19th and 20th centuries provide the content of this course. We will examine their intrinsic value for reflection on the human condition, but also evaluate their potential usefulness in light of current environmental issues, which have become predominant concerns of our time.
It has now been 50 years since the celebration of the first Earth Day in the US and nearly 37 years since the founding of Die Grünen in Germany. Environmentalism has gone from a fringe idea to a global agenda. It has appropriated the term “green” by setting forth a highly politicized agenda focused on global climate change and income redistribution. Solutions are relentlessly high tech: hyper-urbanism, artificial agriculture, and “smart” technologies are  presented as the only feasible responses to the global environmental crisis. The course will examine the American “green tradition” as a potential alternative or corrective to these developments.

Key words – space, place, everyday life, public, architecture, city planning, preservation, urbanism, urbanization, modernism, consumerism, suburbanization, gentrification
The city is a universal development of civilization, a form of spatial organization combining administrative, economic and political functions. But cities and their urban networks are also particular cultural formations that can differ from one to society to the next. Clearly much can be said about a society in terms of how its cities developed and how they are understood and experienced.
In classical Greece, the city was indivisible from the common life and entailed such concepts as citizenship, politics, the state and even human nature. Classical urbanism in effect defined humankind as a political animal (Aristotle). In the making of modern Europe capital cities became the official expression of the state and the nation – an urbanism centered on architectural and monumental expressions of State power: the city became the “head” of the national body. The place of cities in U.S. American society has never been secure. American cities might be said to embody something of a paradox: at once powerful expressions of technological inventiveness and economic might they have been rejected as a suitable places to live. The postwar decline of American cities and their prospective (and sometimes actual) renewal has been a major and continuing concern of urban critics, reformers, city planners and geographers since the 1960s.
Your readings are organized around the following themes: postwar urbanization/suburbanization, what is urbanism? cities as expressions of place and community, urban design and the lives of the city, gentrification, decline and renewal in our time.

Course content
American Social history is essentially the history or ordinary people and ordinary lives. It includes many subfields, such as gender, race, religion, education, ethnicity, family, sexuality, popular culture and others. Studying the intersections between subfields can enlighten us as to what it means to be American with competing identities, and how ordinary people create, negotiate, and battle over such cultural boundaries. It is a vibrantly interdisciplinary field which uses a wide variety of research methods and techniques.
This course will investigate a particular research question within American Social history. We will read competing interpretations of that problem and engage in practical research using some of the techniques available to social historians.

",,,"
Course content
This course will examine the intersections between memory (individual and collective) and historical truth in the United States. Collective memory and public history negotiate competing ideas of national and group identity. Trauma is a part of this – for victims, perpetrators, and their descendants.  We will examine how public history renegotiates these traumas to support cultural definitions of history with which contemporary citizens can find pride. We will look at memorializing memory by public history in the form of monuments, museums and physical memorials, as well as debates over how to teach history in the United States. Screen portrayals may also be used to understand this link between past, present, and future. Some examples of possible topics within the course can be: how  the reparations movement competes with other historical portrayals that redefine the south and slavery, arguments about how to memorialize  the wars of the 20th century, and how such events as the Trail of Tears are dealt with and reinterpreted in the creating of national mythology surrounding the westward movement, and debates over how to memorialize the events of 9-11.  There may be an element of comparison with how women’s history has been memorialized in the United States and Norway.  Primary sources to be used are movies, public history sites and museums as shown online, newspaper accounts and speeches.

Course content
In this course we study the theory and methods used within American and British studies. The course is designed to provide master students with the theoretical and methodological basis they need for, both deciding on the project for their master thesis, and for carrying out their research. It has three main components, addressing the twin pillars of area studies: history and contemporary society.
The first part of the course looks at the central theoretical questions raised within history as an academic discipline, how the discipline has developed over time, as well as the historical method, while the second part addresses the historical development of American Studies. A main concern in our approach to American Studies is to look at the central themes of contention which have marked the discipline. In the third part we focus on British Studies with a main emphasis on the development of British Cultural Studies (in the post-war period), and the state of British Studies today.
A central theme throughout the course is to compare and contrast the study of the United States with that of the United Kingdom.

Be able to recognize through the analysis of contemporary cartography the transnational routes taken by many kinds of migrants across different borders of Europe and Scandinavia

",,,"
Course content
The course offers a broad introduction to Migration into and within Europe and Scandinavia from 2015 to present times. The emphasis  will be given to the study of the realities and cultural representations of both emigration and immigration and the economic, sociocultural and cognitive effects migration may have on migrants as well as on European citizens and national institutions.
Forced migration towards Europe has had a deep cognitive and emotional impact on the migrant subjects, shaping their economic situation and their individual and collective identity. It has even disrupted not only migrants’ own consciences, but also the way that national governments in Europe and worldwide have perceived what now is referred to in the media as the refugee crisis. The main influx of non-European migrants has been mainly through a) Greece and the Balkan countries, b) Libya and Italy, and c) the Spain’s African territories (Ceuta and Melilla) into Andalusia.  
To the extent that it is relevant, the textual and cultural representations of both emigration and immigration in Europe and Scandinavia will be studied in relation to their historical and social background as well as from an interdisciplinary and an inter-national perspective.

Course content
This is an elective master’s course developed within the Literature, Cognition, and Emotions research and teaching initiative.
Course content
This course provides an overview of the key concepts of cognitive poetics by first introducing the field and subsequently concentrating on a set of interrelated concepts, each of which is explained and explored by studying literary texts belonging to various genres and literary periods.
The concepts focused on include metaphor, metonymy, image schemata, and embodiment. We discuss the notion of conceptual metaphor in literature studies, specifically focusing on the conventionality and creativity of metaphors, and the relation of metaphor to blending (conceptual integration), embodied simulation, image schemata, and iconicity. The last two concepts are discussed beyond metaphor: image schemata as an inherent part of narrative representations, and iconicity as a process by which a product of human cognition connects with some aspects of the experienced world.
Further categories discussed include figure and ground, deixis and viewpoint, multimodality, as well as a brief introduction to the empirical study of literature. All the notions will be revisited in the concluding seminar session(s) on literary creativity.
The originals of all the literary texts discussed are either English or Norwegian, and, if not, translations are provided of the excerpts discussed. Students are encouraged to engage with the course topics by studying texts of their own choice, in which case translations of the text excerpts relevant for the general discussion in the seminars should be provided.
In addition to traditional teaching methods, we will use and further develop a full range of digital teaching materials, including short video lectures such as those already available on the LCE website (https://www.hf.uio.no/english/research/strategic-research-areas/lce/studies/digital-teaching-materials.html

Course content
Democracy means that people have a say in who governs a nation, regardless of their educational or social status. But there's no guarantee that the voters in a democracy will make good choices. What if people's voting decisions are motivated by hatred, greed, ignorance or false beliefs? In recent years, fake news and alternative facts have received a lot of attention. It is not always easy to identify trustworthy sources of information. We might assume that science can give us answers here. Many people think of science as dealing in facts, rather than values, as being objective, rather than biased, as being rational rather than emotional.
Others are suspicious of so-called scientific expertise and objectivity. Are scientists more trustworthy than other people? Are 'scientific findings' less likely to be contaminated by subjective interests and bias? Science has historically been dominated by a small and powerful group of people. Its methods have in the past been used to justify and perpetuate oppression. Should we feel suspicious of science? Or of people who are 'science-sceptics'? How should democratic societies deal with these challenges?
These questions will form a central part of this course. We will examine the role of science in society. What role should scientific expertise have in a democratic society? How - if at all - are moral, political or religious values relevant to science? How important is social context for scientific research? What challenges arise when members of the public lose trust in science? If people can't be sure that the government's scientific advisors are reliable, or what agenda they follow, how should scientists, governments and societies respond to this?
The course also includes a series of case studies, which will vary from year to year, but will cover issues such as climate change, decolonising academia, gene modification, artificial intelligence, 'fake news', academic freedom and freedom of speech, human enhancement, the pandemic, and many other topics. Students will also get the chance to put forward their own suggestions for case studies to focus on in class.

On the one hand, the course will engage with philosophical questions **about** psychology. We will, for example, consider the nature of psychological explanation, the relationship between psychological and neuroscientific explanations, the nature and the role of mental representations, predictive coding and Bayesian models of the brain.
On the other hand, we will look at how, if at all, psychological research can help to answer traditional philosophical questions. Case studies may include: rationality, animal minds, the nature of concepts, psychiatric disorders, the self, moral psychology, or consciousness.
We will consider questions like these: Do chimpanzees, birds, or lobsters feel pain? How can we study consciousness scientifically? Are we, humans, rational (could science show that we are not)? What does the theory evolution tell us about the way we think and act? Does thinking happen in a kind of language? What can brain imaging tell us about the mind? Does cognition happen only in the brain, or might it be ""extended"" to include the body and environment? What is the relationship between our cognitive and our social capacities? How should we understand implicit attitudes and implicit bias?

Moral philosophy (ethics) can be divided, from the more theoretical to the more practical, into metaethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics. In this course, we explore central themes in metaethics and normative ethics. The course might have special focus on either metaethics or normative ethics at different semesters. Metaethics describes morality from different philosophical perspectives, such as semantics, ontology, and epistemology. The following type of issues are discussed: What is the meaning of moral terms (such as ‘right’, ‘wrong’) and moral sentences? Are moral sentences true or false? Are there any moral properties or facts in the world that can make them true? If so, what are they like? Is it possible to know what objects have these properties? If so, how do we reach such knowledge? Normative ethics concerns what ultimately explains the moral status of actions. The following type of issues are discussed: Is only consequences of actions relevant to determine their moral status? If not, what other aspects are morally significant? What is it that makes a person’s life good or bad? What is it that makes a state of affair good or bad?

Course content
Political philosophy concerns how to organize relations among individuals who are members of societies. The following type of issues are central: How can individuals retain their freedom when they submit to political authority? How can the authority of the state be justified, and what should be its limits? What is a just distribution of goods and burdens? What is the role of public deliberation in democratic decision-making? Do individuals possess rights merely in virtue of their humanity? Important contributions have been made by philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Mill, Marx, Arendt, Rawls and Habermas.
Political philosophy is sometimes closely related to ethics, but many political philosophers seek justifications for principles that reflect what is unique in political life. On an expansive conception of political philosophy it includes legal philosophy and social philosophy. The course might have a special focus on either the history of political philosophy or systematic approaches to political philosophy at different semesters.

Course content
Political philosophy concerns how to organize relations among individuals who are members of societies. The following type of issues are central: How can individuals retain their freedom when they submit to political authority? How can the authority of the state be justified, and what should be its limits? What is a just distribution of goods and burdens? What is the role of public deliberation in democratic decision-making? Do individuals possess rights merely in virtue of their humanity? Important contributions have been made by philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Mill, Marx, Arendt, Rawls and Habermas.
Political philosophy is sometimes closely related to ethics, but many political philosophers seek justifications for principles that reflect what is unique in political life. On an expansive conception of political philosophy it includes legal philosophy and social philosophy. The course might have a special focus on either the history of political philosophy or systematic approaches to political philosophy at different semesters.

",,,"
Course content
By focusing on women’s moral experiences and moral reasoning, feminist ethics contributes to renewing, rethinking and expanding our knowledge within meta-ethics, normative ethic, applied ethics and on real life moral dilemmas. In particular, theorizing on care and care work has produced a significantly different set of analytical tools than those inherited from conventional moral philosophy. New conceptualizations, methods, models and questions enable care ethicists to approach traditional ethical issues in a novel way, to bring new or neglected challenges to the forefront, as well as broaden our comprehension of what counts as ethically relevant. 
 
This development in feminist ethics has also made possible a new approach towards conflicts and conflict resolutions. These advancements are highly relevant in today’s world, and will be the main focus of the course. We will explore how feminist care ethics deals with conflicts, and also examine the theory’s differences, strengths and weaknesses by contrasting it with other ethical theories. Thematically, the course will be organized around four topics. (1) Care and conflict in private and professional relationships (e.g. abortion, human reproduction, professional care-work). (2) Care and conflict in war and peace (e.g. violence, conflict solving, peace building). (3) Care and conflict in global relations (e.g. poverty, migrations). (4) Care and conflict with nature (e.g. vegetarianism, animal rights, land ethics). 
 
This course is part of the The Gender and Philosophy project, offering an intensive 5 days summer course sponsored by an Erasmus+ grant, focusing on the subject of gender and philosophy from four different viewpoints. Each summer school has its own distinct theme introduced by specialists in the field of study and offers an innovative and exciting forum for discussion and learning.

Course content
In 386 BCE Rome was sacked by itinerant Gallic tribes, and was still a regional power of limited relevance, whereas in 146 BCE it had built a powerful Mediterranean empire, able to destroy once-mighty cities such as Carthage and Corinth, and to depose powerful Hellenistic kings. The rise of Rome from a humble city-state to an imperial power able to dominate the Mediterranean area for centuries is in its own right a historiographical problem that has caused profound reflections and debates already from antiquity. This process of conquest and imperialism in the Mediterranean area is inextricably intertwined with the history of the Italian peoples, who were ‘unified’ under Roman rule already in the third century BCE.
This course will look at the political, cultural, and economic dimension of Roman imperialism, the relevant primary sources and the current historiographical debates. Firstly, we will study the motives of Roman aggression and the causes for their success. Secondly, we will also look at the ways in which the Romans understood and conceptualised their imperial practices as ‘self-defence’ and ‘just war’. Thirdly, we will consider the role of the other Italian peoples in the Roman imperial project, and how the peninsula underwent processes of integration and cultural change that was instrumental to, but not necessarily bound with, Roman imperial expansion.
The “Italian question” is one of the key elements for our comprehension of the history of Republican Rome, and it had profound consequences in the social and political crisis which led to the fall of the Republic and the institution of Imperial autocracy towards the end of the first century BCE. How should we understand the dynamics of this long process of integration and the immense change it caused?

Course content
From the first century, much of southern Britain was part of the Roman Empire. However, in the early fifth century, Roman troops were withdrawn from the island, leaving its inhabitants open to attack and invasion. In the years following the Roman withdrawal different groups of Germanic-speaking peoples settled in Britain, ultimately forming independent kingdoms. These settlers were later known by the name Anglo-Saxons.
This course will follow the development of these independent kingdoms from their origins through to the tenth century, when the kingdoms were first governed together as a realm united under a single king. During this course, students will learn about the rich cultural heritage of the Anglo-Saxon period, including significant works of art and literature. A major emphasis will be placed on investigating and problematizing the written sources from this period, which will include Bede’s Ecclesiastical History, as well as saints’ lives, letters, literary texts, and chronicles. Through discussion and debate, students will assess the reliability of these textual sources in light of new historical and archaeological research.

The Vikings are commonly viewed as the most noticeable Scandinavian contribution to global history. Indeed, the raiding and trading Vikings left their traces across Northern Europe and beyond, and the Scandinavian emigration of the ninth and tenth centuries left noticeable imprints on adjacent regions such as Carolingian Francia, Anglo-Saxon England, the North Atlantic and Eastern Europe. Scholars debate different aspects of this transforming and expanding society. Yet most of them agree that ostentatious consumption was a key feature of Viking culture; those who owned the best weapons and largest ships were able to distribute the most precious gifts among their followers. The Vikings brought home not only material riches, but also new ideas as well as a new religion, which changed Scandinavia dramatically in the long run. In this course, we will discuss several important topics pertaining to the Viking Age, namely Viking Age political and material culture, religious transformation, social relations, trade and communication, with a particular focus on the interplay between internal and external factors.

This course aims to familiarize students with a number of topics pertaining to early medieval cultural history such as political culture, ritual, cult of saints, magic, visual art, literacy, orality, and various forms of visual communication. Some of them have been focusing points of ardent academic discussion in the past two decades. The course will therefore not only overview those selected topics of early medieval cultural history but also introduce students to on-going theoretical debates in that field – such as the nature and role of early medieval rituals and the interplay between literary texts and other media, between word and image, and between literacy and orality. Students will also learn to critically read relevant academic literature and to participate in related oral discussions in English.
The course is intended for students with a working knowledge of English, who have already taken introductory survey courses in medieval history and are familiar with the factual and chronological framework of European history between c.300 to c.1000.

Course content
The early Middle Ages was the period that witnessed the profound transformation of Europe in economic, social, and political spheres. Last but not the least, a radical cultural change took place in those centuries, whereby a new world of Christian Europe was built upon the remnants of the classical civilization. Many cultural traits of that world have survived into modern times and are repeatedly invoked in modern debates on European identity. Moreover, the new cultural history, a new historiographic trend gaining popularity from the 1990s, has made medieval culture a field of historiographic research as important as medieval political or economic history. It is not surprising therefore that various topics of early medieval culture have attracted growing interest among medievalists in the past few decades. This interest combined with new methodological insights have thus made the history of early medieval culture a vibrant academic field both in Europe and North America.

Course content
The cult of saints was a central part of the Christian faith in the Middle Ages. It became an important part of conversion and arguably the single most important aspect of Christianity for common people, with saints able to intercede and protect people through miracles in a way that the Norse gods could not. By dying the saints were thought to reach a place of vicinity to God and were therefore in a favourable position for interceding with God on behalf of the living. Thus one thought that the saints were functioning as intermediary links between God and the humans, and that they especially could be turned to in suffering and need.
The saints and their relics were to be treated in a respectful manner. If one failed to do so the wrath of the saints could be cast upon you. On the other hand, the saints had to prove to be worthy of being invoked. If some saints seemed to be less powerful than others, one would stop praying to the former. The saints therefore had to constantly prove their powerfulness or risking that their cult disappeared. As a result the cult of saints was constantly changing.
These are amongst the aspects of the cult of saints in Norway and Iceland that this course will address. In addition we will also compare the development of the cult of saints in Norway and Iceland to other parts of Western Europe.

Viking Age Europe is a useful term to approach the history of Northern Europe from c. 750 to c. 1050. In this period, Scandinavia was characterized by a high degree of social mobility and profound socio-political changes. The Scandinavian emigration of the ninth and tenth centuries left noticeable imprints on adjacent regions such as Carolingian Francia, Anglo-Saxon England, the North Atlantic and Eastern Europe. The political and religious impacts of Ottonian Germany, Anglo-Saxon England, early Rus’ and Byzantium on tenth- and eleventh-century Scandinavia were equally important. These waves of mutual interaction defined the history of Viking Age Europe and the ways in which social and political communities were shaped there and various identities were forged and manifested.

Rather than giving the attention to the Vikings’ activity abroad, this course will on Scandinavian society, and on the causes of the Viking Age. We will look at four different aspects of Scandinavian society:

Politics. The political development in Scandinavia c. 800-1050, and the superior position of the Danish kings.
Social structure. Scandinavian society was highly stratified (kings/chieftains, householders and trells). How was social status displayed?
Old Norse religion and the Christianization process. Why was the introduction of Christianity so important to the kings?, How did the new religion affect the Viking mentality?
Economy and trade. Leadership in Viking Age society depended on the display of wealth. Leaders needed riches and luxury goods in order to win the fierce competition in consumption.

Course content
Comparative history helps us understand what is unusual or unique about each of the societies that we compare. This course teaches us more about both Italy and Scandinavia by comparing their history during the Middle Ages.
In this course we will focus on four topics in medieval Italy and Scandinavia: wars within and between polities, the Church as a political actor, internal violence, and legal culture. In each field, we will find striking similarities between Scandinavia and Italy but also startling differences. While central and northern Italy was precociously urbanized, most of Scandinavia remained largely rural. At the same time as Italians experimented with republican constitutions, Scandinavia was governed by kings. But there are also similarities. In both societies, conflicts played out both within and between polities, as wars, feuds and political rivalries. Moreover, clashes between the state and church played out in similar ways, and Norwegian law shared some basic assumption with Italian laws.
The course will draw extensively on primary sources and allow the students to explore facets of political culture by analyzing chronicles, laws and charters in a comparative way.

Course content
The history of human societies and the history of technology are closely linked. This course presents an overview of the history of technology, and the analytical challenges that it presents. Although humans have used tools and technologies from the earliest phases of human evolution, our own society uniquely rests on rapid and sustained innovation and technological change. Major issues in our world are related to the path of technological history. A central theme of the course is the importance of understanding technologies in terms of the economic and social contexts within which they are developed and utilised. Technologies are not simply artefacts, but are artefacts that evolve within frameworks of economic incentives and social conflict. Technology has social impacts over time, but it is also shaped by the social world. This course explores the overall process of technological development since Classical Antiquity (500 B.C.-500 A.C.), through the Medieval period, the Renaissance and the modern period. We examine technological development through discussions of the history of industrialisation, case studies of the development of specific technologies, and discussions of key themes in the history of innovation and technological change (such as technology and imperialism, gender, resistance and patent systems). The course takes developments in Europe as its starting point, but includes where possible the history of innovation and technological change in many other parts of the world.

Course content
A central but as yet unanswered question is why some countries are rich while others are poor. Today, a growing number of scholars address this question by looking to history. Answers are sought by adopting a global perspective, by comparing the development paths of countries and regions across the world, and by analysing the inter-connections between them. This course focuses on some of the key results and unresolved questions this research effort has produced, particularly with regard to the period prior to and during early western European industrialisation and with a focus on Britain and China.
We know that in the 19th century a gap had opened up with, on the one hand, European and North American countries set on a development path towards prosperity, and, on the other hand, most other countries in the world remaining trapped in a situation of poverty. The Western countries broke away from the ‘Malthusian trap’ which prevents long term economic growth as population growth cancels out increases in material welfare. And they shifted from intermittent, ‘extensive’ economic growth (that relied on a more graduated division of labour and is known as ‘Smithian’ growth) to sustained growth, based on continuous innovation and technological change. The rest of the world did not follow suit during this period - it stagnated. So why did this ‘great divergence’ in economic development happen? How can we understand and explain ‘the Rise of the West’ and ‘the Decline of the East’?
The course focuses on two main themes in global history. First, the theme of connections between regions. Here global trade is important, but also cultural exchanges. Second, the theme of comparison. It explores similarities and differences in areas such as living standards, agricultural and industrial developments and also institutions. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on the key issue of ‘knowledge’. If we are to identify and understand the key factors behind innovation based wealth creation then we must analyse the capabilities, practices and conceptions on which innovation rested. And if we want to understand global knowledge creation, then we must look at how knowledge travelled, and how local knowledges interacted with global trends.
This course discusses some of the central issues and questions in the field, with a focus on China and Britain. It examines the vigorous debates, the agreements and disagreements that have evolved during recent years. The overall aim is to increase our understanding of how regional, national and global conditions fostered economic growth in some, but not other parts of the world.

Course content
Historians have studied the past in different ways and with changing interests. They have tried to assess the importance of 'great figures' and pivotal events and traced the ordinary lives of ordinary people. They have looked for cultures and economies, experience and mentalities, emotions and ideas as key factors in human development. They have focussed on towns, regions and nations, on the West, the East and the connections between them. Historians' questions, objects of study and methods change, because they constantly debate the validity of their interpretations among themselves and take inspiration from other disciplines. This is called historiography and has, as all things human, a history.
The course is looking at social history as a particular episode in the history of historiography. This period began with many historians turning towards workers and social-economic structures and the application of models and methods derived from the social sciences. The course presents major themes, theories and debates of social history since its rise in the 1960s. To this end, it takes Geoff Eley's book A Crooked Line: From Cultural History to the History of Society (2005) – an intellectual autobiography of a former social historian turned cultural historian – as a starting point to explore the potential and problems of social history and delve into exemplary studies. The first part of the course covers the growth of social history and its subsequent critique from the 1960s into the 1980s, looking at developments in the US, Britain, Germany and Norway. The second part focusses on current research on the history of class, capitalism, consumption, culture and labour to reflect on the opportunities of present-day social history.

Course content
Focusing on examples from the US, Britain and Germany, the course offers an introduction to central issues of twentieth-century social history as well as to concepts and methods to study them. It understands social history as the study of social relations, of inclusions, exclusions and identities in the past. The course invites students to think about how changes in markets, politics, technology and culture affected distinctions of class, gender, race and age during the period. Traversing the century chronologically, the seminar first asks how the use of money affected social relations in and around the working class around the turn of the century and then looks at encounters between the sexes and races in early twentieth-century metropolises. It then assesses the effect of mass media on people's self-perceptions and collective orientations, searches for those excluded from mass societies of the 1930s and early 40s, and studies the role of the military in society. In the post-war period, the course turns to the consumer society and its countercultural critics as well as the history of new social movements and the effects of social housing and ‘gentrification’ on urban communities.

Course content
The course provides an introduction to a field which has recently come to be known as Comparative Genocide Studies, with a clear focus on the destruction of the European Jews by Nazi Germany. It will cover various protagonists in the Holocaust, not only perpetrators but also victims, bystanders, and collaborators, as well as a range of contexts in which mass extermination took place. Ideological prerequisites which fueled mass murder will figure alongside the post-war attempts to tackle the crimes by judicial means. With this basis established, a comparative perspective will be assumed by looking into other (modern) cases of mass extermination – from the murder of Turkish Armenians to the so-called ethnic cleansing during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s – which have been labelled genocides.
The course has two agendas. First, it will provide a firm empirical basis and understanding of the Holocaust as well as of its historiography. Second, by shedding light on other case studies, the relative merits of categories such as ‘genocide’ will be explored, and the question of political implications of terminology and definitions shall be discussed. The course will also look at its subject from different methodological angles. Standard textual sources will be employed along with audio and various visual materials; the ‘history of events’ will be accompanied by analysis of representations and discursive practices.

",,,"
Course content
For many countries in Western Europe, World War II and Axis occupation marked the greatest crisis in twentieth century history. Taking the example of France, Norway, and Denmark, the course will show that defeat and occupation, collaboration and resistance, survival and compromise were some of the central categories of experience during those years. Different coping strategies evolved as the French and their European neighbours sought to deal with the changing circumstances they faced between 1939 and 1945. The legacy of the war was understandably divisive so that the historiography of the subject since 1945 has been written against a changing backdrop of political conflict, official commemoration, social change and the uncomfortable emergence of repressed memories. This makes the topic an ideal one for exploring the relationship of professional history-writing with political and ideological history formation and with questions of memory and commemoration. How independent historians are from such processes and whether they may be inspired or compromised by them will be key issues for study. The shifting relationship between collective memory and collective amnesia in France, Norway, and Denmark will also be central to our analysis of the different works of academic and popular history which will be studied. Most of the key works have been written in English or translated that no knowledge of French, Norwegian and Danish is necessary.

Course content
In the 19th century, exploration was at the crossroads of science, cultural contact, colonialism, imperialism, but also sport, and celebrity. Looking at exploration is hence a good way to get a different perspective on major aspects of 19th-century history. This course gives an introduction to the central issues in the study of exploration during the long 19th century, from the South American travels of Alexander von Humboldt (1799-1804) until Roald Amundsen reached the South Pole in 1911.
In this course, we will alternate between analysis of the broad traits of the exploration from a global perspective and over the whole century, and case studies centred on a few expeditions. We will discuss texts written by historians and other scholars and analyse a broad range of historical documents: texts, maps, and illustrations.

The history of consumerism in the twentieth century has become a vital and vibrant area of academic research. This module offers insights into this relatively new field of work taking a broad transnational perspective. The aim is to show that the history of consumption is a promising alternative approach to the historical analysis of society. The module combines traditional political history with recent research topics, such as environment, generation and gender relations. Strong emphasis will be laid on the interaction of consumption, politics, society and economy within different European political systems. Throughout the seminars there will be made use of different kinds of primary material, ranging from more traditional written sources to visual materials such as posters and adverts.

Course content
Popular culture – defined here as the accumulated store of leisure activities and media content that a considerable amount of people has a stake in – was an increasingly important feature of 20th century Western societies. Ever more time and a growing share of peoples’ incomes were allotted to the consumption of popular culture. Due to the reach and speed of communication media, popular culture from pop music to movies, television programmes, fashion and advertising was distributed to all corners of the world. Global sporting competitions were held, the results of national sporting leagues were eagerly awaited by fans on the other side of the globe. The culture industry became big business, and working in entertainment a proper job. People were identified and identified themselves in reference to the popular culture they engaged in, and symbolic objects were interpreted as mirrors of the “Zeitgeist”. Popular culture became politicised, as protest was communicated in popular songs, politicians sought affiliation with stars and governments as well as social groups tried to regulate popular culture.
The growing prominence of popular culture was not lost on critics, commentators and – finally – social scientists who interpreted the relevance of pop in peoples’ lives in very different ways. Some have demonised the culture industry as a conspiracy started to delude the masses, others took it as the most authentic expression of peoples’ values, norms and beliefs, and still others have celebrated popular culture as a site where “the people” evaded the control of “the power bloc”. Some scientists have said that modern popular culture from the centres has steamrollered the particularities of local cultures, while others argue that popular culture drives social differentiation. Some have claimed that popular culture has got levelling potential, as it cuts across divisions of status, race and gender; others have highlighted that these social distinctions were reproduced and even confirmed in the realm of popular culture. Other strands of research have focussed on the question of cultural change, still others take the creative industries as an economic sector where we can see the future of labour relations, the organisation of work and the creation of wealth.
The course intents to give both a general overview over major trends in the history of popular culture from the late 19th to the late 20th century and introduce students to key debates in historical and social scientific research on the topic. Looking at evidence from different realms of popular culture such as popular music, cinema, advertising and sport in Britain, the US and Germany, the seminar takes technological and regulatory caesura as an orientation and discusses prominent aspects of the relationship between popular culture and society. Keeping in mind the questions of cultural change and the societal effect of popular culture, the course covers aspects from leisure and social control to the globalisation of popular culture, state interference with culture and pop as a medium of identity. This will be done on the basis of key readings and discussion of sources.

Course content
Published in 1845, Friedrich Engels’s book Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England (The Condition of the Working Class in England) describes how industrialisation affected the lives of working people, based in part on his encounters with them at a Manchester cotton mill. Regarding industrial labour as both a consequence of an ongoing class struggle and the sparkplug for the revolution that would end it one day, Engels told a story of industrial work as a catalyst for political change that was going to happen the world over, one nation at a time. Fast forward a good hundred and fifty years, we see the perspective on work and labour shifted. Industrial wage labour has moved in large parts to the Global South and is less clearly distinguishable from unfree labour. Unemployment has arisen as a major issue in wealthy countries. New forms of work have attracted scholarly attention, from domestic, reproductive and service labour (partly unpaid and often done by women) to creative work, where self-realisation is considered as much a reward as financial compensation. Fairness of pay and conditions is still an important concern, but it has become more difficult to mobilise for it, as dwindling union membership and the decline of Labour parties indicate.

Course content
Why should historians study movies? This basic question is at the very heart of this course, which places moving images from the late 19th century to the present in their wider economic, social, political, and cultural contexts. Engaging with a variety of theoretical approaches, the course addresses the four main issues “production”, “regulation”, “meaning” and “consumption”. Firstly, it follows the development of the film business in different countries to understand how technology, law and regulation, industry structure and labor shaped film content to a considerable extent. Secondly, the course highlights the various influences politics, the military, churches, and other social groups exerted on the production of movies, in particular on film contents that were often channeled and censored to fit specific political agendas and moral norms. Thirdly, the course focuses on selected genres and their meaning for our understanding of history. Fourthly, the course raises questions about cinema-going and audiences’ experience. How does movie-goers engage with films and make sense of them in the light of their own needs, expectations, and hopes? In what ways and to what extent does film condition the ways we perceive realities? 
In our course, there will be particular emphasis on the analysis of primary sources which, in this instance, will include visual material such as movie posters and adverts, as well as a selection of films that are exemplary for the wider issues that we want to discuss in class. We will screen these movies at full length and analyze them with you.

This course will survey the foreign policies of the United States government from 1898 to the present, while emphasizing the deep and complex embeddedness of America with other regions of the world. Relations with East Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe will be emphasized. A major theme will be the rise of nationalism around the world and the way that the United States has responded to this phenomenon and been affected by it during the era of ascendant American power. It is often said that the United States first became an empire in 1898 when it conquered the Philippines and other lands from Spain. Yet controversy has surrounded broader claims that the U.S. is an imperial power. Ironically, in the years after the attacks on America of 11 September 2001, it became common for analysts of all perspectives to call America an empire. Now the debate focuses on the nature of that imperial power. This course will equip students to analyze and evaluate historical claims about the precise nature and extent of America’s role in the world from 1898 to now.

",,,"
Course content
What is intellectual property? Can authors own their ideas? Are pirates heroes or criminals?  What are the commons, and can anyone govern them? The answers to these questions are contested and they have changed over time. This makes history a central discipline to interrogate piracy, commons, and ownership as it has been practiced in law, public debate, business, and politics.
Since their rise during the Enlightenment, intellectual property rights have developed in three types: copyright, trademark, patents. Questions emerged during this development: Should authors enjoy moral rights to their ideas, or should everyone be free to copy inventions and bring them to the market? Are patents positive or negative for development? Competing and conflicting visions of what is an inventor or an artist emerged from such debates. Cases from literature, music business, design and the visual arts, the pharmaceutical industry, and agriculture will be used to examine these battles on intellectual property.
Since the nineteenth century governments increasingly started to recognize intellectual property rights in law. Associations at the international level aimed to unify international regimes of knowledge. These international institutions eventually became in 1967 the World Intellectual Property Organization, since 1970 part of the United Nations. The central question that emerged, then, was about the dynamics between the West and the developing countries. Did developed countries try to impose their regimes of knowledge and commerce on the rest of the world? Furthermore, which place was left to the commons?

Course content
In 386 BCE Rome was sacked by itinerant Gallic tribes, and was still a regional power of limited relevance, whereas in 146 BCE it had built a powerful Mediterranean empire, able to destroy once-mighty cities such as Carthage and Corinth, and to depose powerful Hellenistic kings. The rise of Rome from a humble city-state to an imperial power able to dominate the Mediterranean area for centuries is in its own right a historiographical problem that has caused profound reflections and debates already from antiquity. This process of conquest and imperialism in the Mediterranean area is inextricably intertwined with the history of the Italian peoples, who were ‘unified’ under Roman rule already in the third century BCE.
This course will look at the political, cultural, and economic dimension of Roman imperialism, the relevant primary sources and the current historiographical debates. Firstly, we will study the motives of Roman aggression and the causes for their success. Secondly, we will also look at the ways in which the Romans understood and conceptualised their imperial practices as ‘self-defence’ and ‘just war’. Thirdly, we will consider the role of the other Italian peoples in the Roman imperial project, and how the peninsula underwent processes of integration and cultural change that was instrumental to, but not necessarily bound with, Roman imperial expansion.
The “Italian question” is one of the key elements for our comprehension of the history of Republican Rome, and it had profound consequences in the social and political crisis which led to the fall of the Republic and the institution of Imperial autocracy towards the end of the first century BCE. How should we understand the dynamics of this long process of integration and the immense change it caused?

Course content
From the first century, much of southern Britain was part of the Roman Empire. However, in the early fifth century, Roman troops were withdrawn from the island, leaving its inhabitants open to attack and invasion. In the years following the Roman withdrawal different groups of Germanic-speaking peoples settled in Britain, ultimately forming independent kingdoms. These settlers were later known by the name Anglo-Saxons.
This course will follow the development of these independent kingdoms from their origins through to the tenth century, when the kingdoms were first governed together as a realm united under a single king. During this course, students will learn about the rich cultural heritage of the Anglo-Saxon period, including significant works of art and literature. A major emphasis will be placed on investigating and problematizing the written sources from this period, which will include Bede’s Ecclesiastical History, as well as saints’ lives, letters, literary texts, and chronicles. Through discussion and debate, students will assess the reliability of these textual sources in light of new historical and archaeological research.

The Vikings are commonly viewed as the most noticeable Scandinavian contribution to global history. Indeed, the raiding and trading Vikings left their traces across Northern Europe and beyond, and the Scandinavian emigration of the ninth and tenth centuries left noticeable imprints on adjacent regions such as Carolingian Francia, Anglo-Saxon England, the North Atlantic and Eastern Europe. Scholars debate different aspects of this transforming and expanding society. Yet most of them agree that ostentatious consumption was a key feature of Viking culture; those who owned the best weapons and largest ships were able to distribute the most precious gifts among their followers. The Vikings brought home not only material riches, but also new ideas as well as a new religion, which changed Scandinavia dramatically in the long run. In this course, we will discuss several important topics pertaining to the Viking Age, namely Viking Age political and material culture, religious transformation, social relations, trade and communication, with a particular focus on the interplay between internal and external factors.

The course will therefore not only overview those selected topics of early medieval cultural history but also introduce students to on-going theoretical debates in that field – such as the nature and role of early medieval rituals and the interplay between literary texts and other media, between word and image, and between literacy and orality. Students will also learn to critically read relevant academic literature and to participate in related oral discussions in English.

Course content
The early Middle Ages was the period that witnessed the profound transformation of Europe in economic, social, and political spheres. Last but not the least, a radical cultural change took place in those centuries, whereby a new world of Christian Europe was built upon the remnants of the classical civilization. Many cultural traits of that world have survived into modern times and are repeatedly invoked in modern debates on European identity. Moreover, the new cultural history, a new historiographic trend gaining popularity from the 1990s, has made medieval culture a field of historiographic research as important as medieval political or economic history. It is not surprising therefore that various topics of early medieval culture have attracted growing interest among medievalists in the past few decades. This interest combined with new methodological insights have thus made the history of early medieval culture a vibrant academic field both in Europe and North America.

Course content
The cult of saints was a central part of the Christian faith in the Middle Ages. It became an important part of conversion and arguably the single most important aspect of Christianity for common people, with saints able to intercede and protect people through miracles in a way that the Norse gods could not. By dying the saints were thought to reach a place of vicinity to God and were therefore in a favourable position for interceding with God on behalf of the living. Thus one thought that the saints were functioning as intermediary links between God and the humans, and that they especially could be turned to in suffering and need.
The saints and their relics were to be treated in a respectful manner. If one failed to do so the wrath of the saints could be cast upon you. On the other hand, the saints had to prove to be worthy of being invoked. If some saints seemed to be less powerful than others, one would stop praying to the former. The saints therefore had to constantly prove their powerfulness or risking that their cult disappeared. As a result the cult of saints was constantly changing.
These are amongst the aspects of the cult of saints in Norway and Iceland that this course will address. In addition we will also compare the development of the cult of saints in Norway and Iceland to other parts of Western Europe.

Viking Age Europe is a useful term to approach the history of Northern Europe from c. 750 to c. 1050. In this period, Scandinavia was characterized by a high degree of social mobility and profound socio-political changes. The Scandinavian emigration of the ninth and tenth centuries left noticeable imprints on adjacent regions such as Carolingian Francia, Anglo-Saxon England, the North Atlantic and Eastern Europe. The political and religious impacts of Ottonian Germany, Anglo-Saxon England, early Rus’ and Byzantium on tenth- and eleventh-century Scandinavia were equally important. These waves of mutual interaction defined the history of Viking Age Europe and the ways in which social and political communities were shaped there and various identities were forged and manifested.

Rather than giving the attention to the Vikings’ activity abroad, this course will on Scandinavian society, and on the causes of the Viking Age. We will look at four different aspects of Scandinavian society:

Politics. The political development in Scandinavia c. 800-1050, and the superior position of the Danish kings.
Social structure. Scandinavian society was highly stratified (kings/chieftains, householders and trells). How was social status displayed?
Old Norse religion and the Christianization process. Why was the introduction of Christianity so important to the kings?, How did the new religion affect the Viking mentality?
Economy and trade. Leadership in Viking Age society depended on the display of wealth. Leaders needed riches and luxury goods in order to win the fierce competition in consumption.

Course content
The history of human societies and the history of technology are closely linked. This course presents an overview of the history of technology, and the analytical challenges that it presents. Although humans have used tools and technologies from the earliest phases of human evolution, our own society uniquely rests on rapid and sustained innovation and technological change. Major issues in our world are related to the path of technological history. A central theme of the course is the importance of understanding technologies in terms of the economic and social contexts within which they are developed and utilised. Technologies are not simply artefacts, but are artefacts that evolve within frameworks of economic incentives and social conflict. Technology has social impacts over time, but it is also shaped by the social world. This course explores the overall process of technological development since Classical Antiquity (500 B.C.-500 A.C.), through the Medieval period, the Renaissance and the modern period. We examine technological development through discussions of the history of industrialisation, case studies of the development of specific technologies, and discussions of key themes in the history of innovation and technological change (such as technology and imperialism, gender, resistance and patent systems). The course takes developments in Europe as its starting point, but includes where possible the history of innovation and technological change in many other parts of the world.

Global warming caused by human activity is transforming our world today. However, climate change is not a new phenomenon. In this course, we will explore how climate change has shaped human history from the Little Ice Age (1300-1800) to contemporary Global Warming. We will use case studies from the Black Death and medieval Norway to the Age of Oil to investigate why some societies are vulnerable and others more resilient to climatic shifts. We will trace how climate change influenced social reform, political upheaval, and technological developments. Finally, we will learn what these examples can contribute to the current debate on climate impacts.

A central but as yet unanswered question is why some parts of the world have become rich while others are poor. Today, a growing number of scholars address this question by looking to history. Answers are sought by adopting a global perspective, where the different development paths of countries and regions are analysed and compared.
We know that, in 1800, a gap had opened up between parts of Europe and Asia, and Europe was getting richer. But we know much less about how and why this had happened. North Western Europe experienced technological and economic progress, as part of the industrialization process which first began in the UK. What were the internal conditions that favoured Britain and Europe? And which external and global factors were decisive?
This course discusses similarities and differences between the experiences of some central regions or countries (in particular parts of China and Britain), with regard to a range of issues (such as living standard, agriculture, trade, technology, institutions and market systems). The aim is to increase our understanding of how regional, national and global conditions fostered economic growth in some, but not other parts of the world.

Course content
What made the Middle Ages unique and medieval society inherently different from classical antiquity and modernity? Historians answer these questions in many different manners, but the study of medieval political and legal cultures offers one of the most productive and interesting ways to tackle such questions. Christian medieval society broke away from classical polytheistic traditions by bringing a single God to the heart of political and legal culture. In the early Middle Ages, God and religion became the main agents of legitimation for political and legal authority. Consequently, emperors, kings, and princes asserted the grace of God as the transcendent source of their political power, and they claimed to rule as vicars of Christ. In the same period, God took a central place in legal culture and the judgment of God (iudicium Dei) became a key form of judicial procedure in early medieval courts. The iudicium Dei was a method to find out the will of God, and could take different forms, such as trial by battle, trial by fire, or the ordeal of the cross. God continued to play an important role in legal culture in the following centuries, but he took on a much more distant and secondary role with the transition from the iudicium Dei to a “rational judicial procedure” in the high Middle Ages, which however opened not only for the extended use of witness testimony and written documents, but also for the greater use of torture and executions. In the same period, the rise of national kingdoms went hand in hand with the growth of administrative literacy, numeracy, taxation, more complicated forms of government, and political interaction. This process was accompanied with the reformulation of the relationship between rulers and their subjects, as well as between secular (earthly) and clerical (spiritual) authorities.
            In this course, students will study this transformation by discussing the relevant written sources and secondary literature divided into four major topics, namely political culture, key political ideas, judicial procedures, and canon law—two classes allocated for each topic. The first class will introduce students to the main topics of this course, its assignments, and examination forms, whereas the concluding class will overview the main themes of the seminar and will give student the opportunity to discuss the main direction and scope of their course papers.

The Greeks and the Romans had many gods and goddesses. These deities were omnipresent, and they played important roles in all aspects of human life. This course will explore how we should understand them, looking at different ancient sources, including mythological stories, temples, cults and votive gifts. We will also examine how modern scholars have looked at ancient gods and goddesses, sometimes in terms of functions or modes of actions, or as complex personae. Finally, we will consider how the multi-faceted quality of these deities has allowed ancient gods to survive antiquity and thrive in medieval and modern art, literature, and films.

This course poses the question to what degree, or if at all, we may understand the world as it existed in 1000 as global. Did globalization begin only in the eurocentrically labelled “Age of Discovery around 1500, or does the phenomenon have deeper roots? In order to focus our attention and make a wide geographical approach possible, we will study the world at one moment in history, the turn of the first millennium, which we will understand loosely as encompassing a century or two on either side of 1000. To further help us organize our explorations, we will study six long-distance encounters and twelve individual locations. Overarching themes include resources, communications, and impacts. The course affords you the opportunity to research and synthesize the global history of a period over a millennium ago.
 
In our work, you will encounter Arab travelers visiting sub-Saharan Africa, India, Europe, and northern China, just as Chinese and Indian ships carried large quantities of luxury goods to many Indian Ocean ports. At the turn of the first millennium, the Silk Road connected Asian and European civilizations. Scandinavians raided the rest of Europe as Vikings at the same time as they settled not only Iceland and Greenland, but also constructed homesteads on Newfoundland (now in Canada). Settlers in eastern Europe sought to control overland communications to and from Asia. The Maya traded chocolate for turquoise from New Mexico, and gold came to Meso-America from Panama and/or Colombia.

The current debates on blackfacing, Liam Neeson, and Black Lives Matter have taught us that racism still matters. For a long time seen as a phenomenon largely unique to Nazism and thus as an aberration of western values, more recently scholars have acknowledged that racial thought and action fundamentally shaped politics, societies, and cultures across the modern world. Taking a comparative perspective, we will look at the social construction of race and ethnicity, with the aim of understanding the intricate ways the notion of race has functioned in various societies and political systems and affected fields as diverse as housing, educational systems, or the workplace.
In the course, students will respond in writing to assigned readings, building their skills at discerning and assessing scholarly interpretations, and will meet to discuss the readings in small working groups. It will emphasize published scholarship and it will give students a sense of the “state of the field” in key areas of research.
General topics for course units will include the following areas: problems of conceptualizing academic works on racism; colonialism and decolonization; the role of science; and multiculturalism and immigration.

Course content
Modern global society is the world we live in. To study it, some scholars segment it into social realms, distinguishing the state, the economy, the third sector, and the private sphere. Others take its principles of governance into view, focusing on formal laws, informal conventions, or internalised norms (‘governmentality’). Still others start with the actors populating society, including organisations (companies, clubs, etc.), individuals, and non-human actors like animals and machines. Historians and social scientists focusing on actors point out that relations between them are marked by differences in wealth, status, identity, and belief. They ask how social actors connect nevertheless and find shared cultures, common interests, or the cash nexus holding society together. Pointing out that actors migrate, communicate, and trade around the globe, scholars will agree that modern society is inevitably global in its geographical scope. At the same time, they will acknowledge the continuous importance of the nation as a key component of modern society.
The course pursues two major aims. Firstly, it encourages students to look at modern global society from a historical perspective. Since historical reflection is able to put current issues into fresh perspective, it will zoom in on central aspects of modern society from work to play, from knowledge to consumption to see how these have developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to shape the world we live in. Secondly and in addition to histories of modern global society, the course introduces students to important debates in the historiography of modern society. We ask why historians have turned to certain questions and how they conducted their research and built arguments. Reading pivotal texts on concepts like class and gender, structure and agency, the public and the private sphere, the course intends to deepen students’ understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of historical research on the topic.
The seminar consists of two blocks. The first one focuses on crosscutting issues in social and cultural history; the second block zooms in on more specific topics (or social realms). An introductory meeting will introduce the course in more detail, and a meeting on “how to write a course paper” will give students the opportunity to develop ideas for their papers as well as provide guidance on how to approach the task.

Course content
Historians have studied the past in different ways and with changing interests. They have tried to assess the importance of 'great figures' and pivotal events and traced the ordinary lives of ordinary people. They have looked for cultures and economies, experience and mentalities, emotions and ideas as key factors in human development. They have focussed on towns, regions and nations, on the West, the East and the connections between them. Historians' questions, objects of study and methods change, because they constantly debate the validity of their interpretations among themselves and take inspiration from other disciplines. This is called historiography and has, as all things human, a history.
The course is looking at social history as a particular episode in the history of historiography. This period began with many historians turning towards workers and social-economic structures and the application of models and methods derived from the social sciences. The course presents major themes, theories and debates of social history since its rise in the 1960s. To this end, it takes Geoff Eley's book A Crooked Line: From Cultural History to the History of Society (2005) – an intellectual autobiography of a former social historian turned cultural historian – as a starting point to explore the potential and problems of social history and delve into exemplary studies. The first part of the course covers the growth of social history and its subsequent critique from the 1960s into the 1980s, looking at developments in the US, Britain, Germany and Norway. The second part focusses on current research on the history of class, capitalism, consumption, culture and labour to reflect on the opportunities of present-day social history.

Focusing on examples from the US, Britain and Germany, the course offers an introduction to central issues of twentieth-century social history as well as to concepts and methods to study them. It understands social history as the study of social relations, of inclusions, exclusions and identities in the past. The course invites students to think about how changes in markets, politics, technology and culture affected distinctions of class, gender, race and age during the period. Traversing the century chronologically, the seminar first asks how the use of money affected social relations in and around the working class around the turn of the century and then looks at encounters between the sexes and races in early twentieth-century metropolises. It then assesses the effect of mass media on people's self-perceptions and collective orientations, searches for those excluded from mass societies of the 1930s and early 40s, and studies the role of the military in society. In the post-war period, the course turns to the consumer society and its countercultural critics as well as the history of new social movements and the effects of social housing and ‘gentrification’ on urban communities.

Course content

In 1912, the United States was an ascendant industrial power with a large agricultural base, modest in military reach; voting was limited to white men, and society was cleft along hierarchical lines of race and ethnicity. In 2016, it is the world’s sole military superpower, global in its reach, with a society primarily composed of metropolitan centers and an economy led by a tertiary sector and an industrial base beset by tough international challenges; the right to vote is less restricted but not always widely exercised, and society is most rigidly divided by wealth, culture a product of mass-mediated ethnic intermixing. How have the bases and methods of political organization and competition changed—or not changed—amid these transformations?
This is a course in US political history that focuses on key presidential campaigns and elections, starting with 1912 and taking matters up to the present day. You will read detailed accounts of key campaigns and elections. These accounts will inform you of the bases of partisan identity and competition during several important eras in the twentieth-century United States. We will depart from the campaign events defined narrowly to explore the policies and issues that shaped and propelled political debate in the United States during the past century. From the political-media colossus of Teddy Roosevelt to that of Donald Trump, we will mark the distance traveled by US politics.

Course content

The course provides an introduction to a field which has recently come to be known as Comparative Genocide Studies, with a clear focus on the destruction of the European Jews by Nazi Germany. It will cover various protagonists in the Holocaust, not only perpetrators but also victims, bystanders, and collaborators, as well as a range of contexts in which mass extermination took place. Ideological prerequisites which fueled mass murder will figure alongside the post-war attempts to tackle the crimes by judicial means. With this basis established, a comparative perspective will be assumed by looking into other (modern) cases of mass extermination – from the murder of Turkish Armenians to the so-called ethnic cleansing during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s – which have been labelled genocides.
The course has two agendas. First, it will provide a firm empirical basis and understanding of the Holocaust as well as of its historiography. Second, by shedding light on other case studies, the relative merits of categories such as ‘genocide’ will be explored, and the question of political implications of terminology and definitions shall be discussed. The course will also look at its subject from different methodological angles. Standard textual sources will be employed along with audio and various visual materials; the ‘history of events’ will be accompanied by analysis of representations and discursive practices.

Course content
For many countries in Western Europe, World War II and Axis occupation marked the greatest crisis in twentieth century history. Taking the example of France, Norway, and Denmark, the course will show that defeat and occupation, collaboration and resistance, survival and compromise were some of the central categories of experience during those years. Different coping strategies evolved as the French and their European neighbours sought to deal with the changing circumstances they faced between 1939 and 1945. The legacy of the war was understandably divisive so that the historiography of the subject since 1945 has been written against a changing backdrop of political conflict, official commemoration, social change and the uncomfortable emergence of repressed memories. This makes the topic an ideal one for exploring the relationship of professional history-writing with political and ideological history formation and with questions of memory and commemoration. How independent historians are from such processes and whether they may be inspired or compromised by them will be key issues for study. The shifting relationship between collective memory and collective amnesia in France, Norway, and Denmark will also be central to our analysis of the different works of academic and popular history which will be studied. Most of the key works have been written in English or translated that no knowledge of French, Norwegian and Danish is necessary.

In the 19th century, exploration was at the crossroads of science, cultural contact, colonialism, imperialism, but also sport, and celebrity. Looking at exploration is hence a good way to get a different perspective on major aspects of 19th-century history. This course gives an introduction to the central issues in the study of exploration during the long 19th century, from the South American travels of Alexander von Humboldt (1799-1804) until Roald Amundsen reached the South Pole in 1911.
In this course, we will alternate between analysis of the broad traits of the exploration from a global perspective and over the whole century, and case studies centred on a few expeditions. We will discuss texts written by historians and other scholars and analyse a broad range of historical documents: texts, maps, and illustrations.

The module combines traditional political history with recent research topics, such as environment, generation and gender relations. Strong emphasis will be laid on the interaction of consumption, politics, society and economy within different European political systems. Throughout the seminars there will be made use of different kinds of primary material, ranging from more traditional written sources to visual materials such as posters and adverts.

Course content
Popular culture – defined here as the accumulated store of leisure activities and media content that a considerable amount of people has a stake in – was an increasingly important feature of 20th century Western societies. Ever more time and a growing share of peoples’ incomes were allotted to the consumption of popular culture. Due to the reach and speed of communication media, popular culture from pop music to movies, television programmes, fashion and advertising was distributed to all corners of the world. Global sporting competitions were held, the results of national sporting leagues were eagerly awaited by fans on the other side of the globe. The culture industry became big business, and working in entertainment a proper job. People were identified and identified themselves in reference to the popular culture they engaged in, and symbolic objects were interpreted as mirrors of the “Zeitgeist”. Popular culture became politicised, as protest was communicated in popular songs, politicians sought affiliation with stars and governments as well as social groups tried to regulate popular culture.
The growing prominence of popular culture was not lost on critics, commentators and – finally – social scientists who interpreted the relevance of pop in peoples’ lives in very different ways. Some have demonised the culture industry as a conspiracy started to delude the masses, others took it as the most authentic expression of peoples’ values, norms and beliefs, and still others have celebrated popular culture as a site where “the people” evaded the control of “the power bloc”. Some scientists have said that modern popular culture from the centres has steamrollered the particularities of local cultures, while others argue that popular culture drives social differentiation. Some have claimed that popular culture has got levelling potential, as it cuts across divisions of status, race and gender; others have highlighted that these social distinctions were reproduced and even confirmed in the realm of popular culture. Other strands of research have focussed on the question of cultural change, still others take the creative industries as an economic sector where we can see the future of labour relations, the organisation of work and the creation of wealth.
The course intents to give both a general overview over major trends in the history of popular culture from the late 19th to the late 20th century and introduce students to key debates in historical and social scientific research on the topic. Looking at evidence from different realms of popular culture such as popular music, cinema, advertising and sport in Britain, the US and Germany, the seminar takes technological and regulatory caesura as an orientation and discusses prominent aspects of the relationship between popular culture and society. Keeping in mind the questions of cultural change and the societal effect of popular culture, the course covers aspects from leisure and social control to the globalisation of popular culture, state interference with culture and pop as a medium of identity. This will be done on the basis of key readings and discussion of sources.

Course content
Published in 1845, Friedrich Engels’s book Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England (The Condition of the Working Class in England) describes how industrialisation affected the lives of working people, based in part on his encounters with them at a Manchester cotton mill. Regarding industrial labour as both a consequence of an ongoing class struggle and the sparkplug for the revolution that would end it one day, Engels told a story of industrial work as a catalyst for political change that was going to happen the world over, one nation at a time. Fast forward a good hundred and fifty years, we see the perspective on work and labour shifted. Industrial wage labour has moved in large parts to the Global South and is less clearly distinguishable from unfree labour. Unemployment has arisen as a major issue in wealthy countries. New forms of work have attracted scholarly attention, from domestic, reproductive and service labour (partly unpaid and often done by women) to creative work, where self-realisation is considered as much a reward as financial compensation. Fairness of pay and conditions is still an important concern, but it has become more difficult to mobilise for it, as dwindling union membership and the decline of Labour parties indicate.

Course content
Why should historians study movies? This basic question is at the very heart of this course, which places moving images from the late 19th century to the present in their wider economic, social, political, and cultural contexts. Engaging with a variety of theoretical approaches, the course addresses the four main issues “production”, “regulation”, “meaning” and “consumption”. Firstly, it follows the development of the film business in different countries to understand how technology, law and regulation, industry structure and labor shaped film content to a considerable extent. Secondly, the course highlights the various influences politics, the military, churches, and other social groups exerted on the production of movies, in particular on film contents that were often channeled and censored to fit specific political agendas and moral norms. Thirdly, the course focuses on selected genres and their meaning for our understanding of history. Fourthly, the course raises questions about cinema-going and audiences’ experience. How did movie-goers engage with films and make sense of them in the light of their own needs, expectations, and hopes? In what ways and to what extent does film condition the ways we perceive realities? 
In our course, there will be particular emphasis on the analysis of primary sources which, in this instance, will include visual material such as movie posters and adverts, as well as a selection of films that are exemplary for the wider issues that we want to discuss in class. We will screen these movies at full length and analyze them with you.

Course content
This course will survey the foreign policies of the United States government from 1898 to the present, while emphasizing the deep and complex embeddedness of America with other regions of the world. Relations with East Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe will be emphasized. A major theme will be the rise of nationalism around the world and the way that the United States has responded to this phenomenon and been affected by it during the era of ascendant American power. It is often said that the United States first became an empire in 1898 when it conquered the Philippines and other lands from Spain. Yet controversy has surrounded broader claims that the U.S. is an imperial power. Ironically, in the years after the attacks on America of 11 September 2001, it became common for analysts of all perspectives to call America an empire. Now the debate focuses on the nature of that imperial power. This course will equip students to analyze and evaluate historical claims about the precise nature and extent of America’s role in the world from 1898 to now.

",,,"
Course content
What is intellectual property? Can authors own their ideas? Are pirates heroes or criminals?  What are the commons, and can anyone govern them? The answers to these questions are contested and they have changed over time. This makes history a central discipline to interrogate piracy, commons, and ownership as it has been practiced in law, public debate, business, and politics.
Since their rise during the Enlightenment, intellectual property rights have developed in three types: copyright, trademark, patents. Questions emerged during this development: Should authors enjoy moral rights to their ideas, or should everyone be free to copy inventions and bring them to the market? Are patents positive or negative for development? Competing and conflicting visions of what is an inventor or an artist emerged from such debates. Cases from literature, music business, design and the visual arts, the pharmaceutical industry, and agriculture will be used to examine these battles on intellectual property.
Since the nineteenth century governments increasingly started to recognize intellectual property rights in law. Associations at the international level aimed to unify international regimes of knowledge. These international institutions eventually became in 1967 the World Intellectual Property Organization, since 1970 part of the United Nations. The central question that emerged, then, was about the dynamics between the West and the developing countries. Did developed countries try to impose their regimes of knowledge and commerce on the rest of the world? Furthermore, which place was left to the commons?

Course content
Ibsen Between Cultures engages with a broad notion of “culture”. In the traditional sense, Ibsen Between Cultures examines the use of Ibsen’s works in a few selected cultures defined by geography / ethnicity / language. A central feature is to examine the mechanisms that are fundamental to the establishment of aesthetic hierarchies, more specifically the global forces influencing the adoption of these texts within the time frame. In addition, we look at how media culture is shaping the field of Ibsen Studies today. In addition to studying theatre, film and TV adaptations, we also study productions of Ibsen’s life and works in newer digital media such as in live online events and mobile phone applications.
The methodologies covered in this course reflect the wide range of cultural productions based on Ibsen’s works. Theories in Intercultural Performance, Media Studies and Cultural Studies as well as Digital Humanities form the theoretical foundation of the course. Technologies such as performance and text databases (e.g. IbsenStage, HIS, Multilingual Ibsen) as well as Virtual Reality throw new light on how Ibsen’s works, its reception, and his authorship can be studied across analogue and digital cultures. What can we learn about Ibsen’s dramaturgy and his sophisticated use of scenic devices when we visit Bergen’s Komediehuset—Ibsen’s workplace from 1851 to 1857—in virtual reality?

In this course you will get acquainted with key female thinkers. What questions have women been concerned with? How have they interpreted the society around them, and what have been their solutions to contemporary challenges? The curriculum consists of political, religious, philosophical and literary texts written by women. The texts reflect their intellectual breadth and social and political engagement through different periods. The course thus contributes to a richer understanding of the history of ideas and a more nuanced picture of the canon, which has traditionally consisted of men.

The course investigates main points in the intellectual and institutional background for some of the political ideas expressed in the Norwegian Constitution of 1814. It addresses the emergence of a debating public sphere and modern political ideas both in Europe and in Denmark-Norway prior to 1814. The syllabus provides historical overview and presents various theoretical perspectives in the research on the history of the public sphere and modern political ideas. Primary sources will be part of the syllabus.

Course content
Augustine (354-430) was an important figure in his time. As a thinker, he reflects elements of Greco-Roman philosophy as well as his own Christian theology and beliefs. His works have made a lasting impact through the ages and until our own times.
Augustine has had a strong influence on a variety of areas, such as philosophy, theology, perceptions of history, society, language, and anthropology. He has also been a controversial figure, for example in his views on free will, original sin, gender roles, and just war.
If you want to understand important aspects of the history of philosophical thinking in the Western world, Augustine is essential. In the course, we study a central selection of his texts, inquire into the historical and cultural contexts that shaped his thinking, explore his reception history and later interpretations, and also reflect on the relevance of his thinking for today.

Course content
There are a number of significant women in the history of ideas. Yet they have often been marginalized, ignored or forgotten. But the wind has turned: There is now an ever-increasing interest in women’s contributions to the extensive history of knowledge, from antiquity to modern times. In this course you will get acquainted with key female thinkers. What questions have women been concerned with? How have they interpreted the society around them, and what have been their solutions to contemporary challenges? The curriculum consists of political, religious, philosophical and literary texts written by women. The texts reflect their intellectual breadth and social and political engagement through different periods. The course thus contributes to a richer understanding of the history of ideas and a more nuanced picture of the canon, which has traditionally consisted of men.

Course content
This course will give an overview of modern Japanese history, from the late Edo period up until the end of the Cold war in 1989. In English most of this one and half century is often discussed in terms of the pre-war, wartime and post-war periods, on the basis of the seemingly all-important dividing point of the Second World War. In Japanese, however, this time frame is rather divided into the Bakumatsu, Meiji, Taishō and Shōwa periods, which are discussed in much more varied ways.
In this course we will analyze various facets of modern Japan’s political, social, intellectual, constitutional, economic and diplomatic history. We will do so with a strong awareness of world order, in the same way that Japanese from the late 19th century onwards were very much aware of their country as part of a wider (Western) world. And with an equally strong international comparative approach, we will analyze Japan’s unique track-record of being the first non-Western country to successfully modernize, Westernize, industrialize, democratize, and militarize, and on this basis become the only non-Western colonial empire and only non-Western member of the elite group of ""civilised nations"" in the prewar period.
For the postwar period we will analyze the various ways in which the dominant structure of the global Cold War order determined Japan’s internal politics and international relations, and many other fields. And apart from stressing 1945 as a turning point in world and Japanese history, we will also adopt a trans-war approach to understand how Japan continued to be looked upon – and looked upon itself – as an economic giant, the leader of Asia, and the only non-Western member of elite institutions like the G7.
In class we cannot deal with everything. Moreover, we want to stress that history is not ‘one true story’ but rather a perpetual discussion between various competing interpretations. Accordingly, in class we will not repeat what is already in the textbook. We will focus on a few selected issues which we consider most crucial to the understanding of modern Japan, and provide views that will encourage you to go beyond the one-sided interpretations (often presented as historical ‘facts’) in the textbooks.

Social anthropology is the holistic and contextualized study of human lifeways. Contemporary anthropologists study humans and non-humans alike—from day laborers to derivatives traders, wolves to hello kitty, and matsutake mushrooms to cowhide leather—to contemplate on the diverse practices, meanings, and values that animate life in Japan and beyond.
This course introduces students to ethnographic works that grapple with themes such as nation, race, gender, sexuality, disability, food, popular culture, inequality, governance, indigenous minorities, and environmental issues. We will also discuss anthropological ethics and methodologies, as well as how anthropology diverges from and complements other disciplines. Furthermore, the course aims to equip students with conceptual and theoretical tools in order to critically and creatively analyze socio-cultural phenomena.

Course content
Japanese studies is a field, not a discipline. Students will be working on topics that range from modern politics to literature, history, and linguistics, and will therefore be using a wide range of different theories and methods. The aim of this course is to help you to choose a topic for your MA thesis, reflect on the theories and methods that you will need, and to write and present a project plan that will guide your work towards your final thesis.
The course begins with a series of lectures and seminars, revolving around practical exercises in central academic methods that can be expected to have relevance for all of you. These will range from research ethics to exercises in using library databases. After this, an intensive seminar (called ""Academic Survival Kit"" or ASK) will offer you the possibility to make your final decision on the direction that your MA research will take, and settle who will be your supervisor. For the final part of the course, students will be divided into smaller groups based on their research interests and work on more specific methodologies relevant to their chosen topic. The course concludes with a round of presentations, where you will have the opportunity to explain your project plan to your fellow students and the teaching staff and receive feed-back – as well as learn from your fellow students and give comments on their ideas.

Course content
This course focuses on central approaches to the study of modern Japanese literature with emphasis on the interplay between literature, culture and society. How do they influence each other and how does or should this interplay bear on the reading of literature itself? Interpreting Japanese narratives selected from various periods in modern Japan, we will search for a way of reading narratives that will go beyond the literary and sociological divide.
Major and minor historical events and occurrences, such as the Meiji restoration, the defeat of the World War II, student movements, the gas-attack in the Tokyo subway, the earthquakes, and changes in sex-role expectations, economy and demography have provided occasions for creative writing.
The emergence of, and popularity of manga, animation films, TV-games and “light novels” have also influenced the way stories are told. The reading of modern Japanese literature can give important insight into various aspects of Japanese history, culture and society.
A cluster of themes or/and texts to be read and discussed can be adjusted according to the students’ interests and needs. Students who are interested in taking this course are encouraged to contact the teacher prior to the start of the semester.

Course content
The Heisei period has given way to the Reiwa period, and Japan is standing at a crossroads. The social structures that contributed to the post-war economic miracle (e.g. life-time employment and the competitive education system) have lost their self-evidence, and growth has long stagnated. Contemporary Japan has been characterized as a “post-growth society”. It faces challenges such as a rapidly ageing population, ongoing rural decline, far-reaching gender inequality and serious environmental problems. The authorities appear unable to solve these problems, and political participation is low. Popular myths about Japanese society as homogeneous and egalitarian are increasingly problematized, yet remain popular.
Despite these challenges, Japan continues to be an important player internationally, both politically and economically. Japanese popular culture has spread throughout the world, and the “Cool Japan” brand remains strong. Meanwhile, authorities and local actors alike actively seek to revitalize “traditional culture” and “national heritage” in a bid to promote tourism and prevent depopulation. The disasters of 2011 have caused serious crises, but they have also given way to new types of social activism, community outreach, and environmental advocacy.
This is a research-based course that requires active participation from all students. Each semester, we will focus on one core topic, which will be approached from various thematic and theoretical angles. This topic will serve as a prism for the study of contemporary Japanese culture and society. 
In previous years, these topics were “The production of heritage in contemporary Japan” (2017), “Multispecies Japan” (2018), “Japan in the Anthropocene” (spring 2019), “Coastal communities in contemporary Japan: coping with social and environmental change” (autumn 2019), and “Food, Sociality, and Power” (autumn 2020). 
The central theme for autumn 2021 is “Popular Culture: From Godzilla of Post-War Japan to Rilakkuma of Precarious Japan.” Japanese popular culture has been grabbing international headlines of late—Barack Obama thanking Shinzō Abe in 2015 for “all the things we love from Japan, like karate, karaoke, manga, anime, and of course emojis,” and the soaring demand for Pokemon cards amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, just to name a few. In this course, we will examine cultural icons (Hello Kitty, Pokemon, etc.), queer TV personalities (Matsuko Deluxe) and manga (yaoi fiction), Akihabara’s maid cafes, divination arts, humanoid robots, and fandoms in baseball, sumo, and South Korean TV dramas. Drawing from a range of scholarly disciplines, we will grapple with theories of globalization, cultural hegemony and subversion, neoliberalism and precarity, sexuality, queer identities and expressions, and capitalism as they relate to popular culture in Japan and beyond. At the end of the semester, students will each give a presentation and write a 10-page paper about a case study of their own choice.

Course content
In this graduate-level seminar, students will explore key issues in contemporary Japanese society and politics from an interdisciplinary perspective. The course centers on a different theme each semester.
In this graduate-level seminar we will analyze key-issues of modern and contemporary Japanese politics, society and international relations. Since last year was focused on society, this year we will deal with politics, government and international relations. We will focus on central problems that may include such themes as Japanese democracy, two-party rule, populism, immigration, change of the constitution, wartime issues, nationalism, Asian regionalism, Japanese views of the outside world, the expanding role of Japanese military, the US-Japan alliance and other security issues, free trade agreements, and Japan’s position within Asia in the light of the recent rise of China. We will do so on the basis of Japanese primary sources and English-language academic sources. The latter will include sources that provide an international perspective and related theoretical background in the fields of political science and international relations.
The content of this course is not pre-determined. As far as possible this course will be given detailed content by the students themselves, on the basis of their interests and/or the themes of their theses. We will have a first preliminary meeting where we we will discuss and decide the content of this year’s course. Two thirds of the meetings will consist of lectures, student presentations and discussions. The remaining third will consist of reading selections of Japanese primary sources translated by the students in advance.
The meetings are centred on debates in the field of Japanese politics, government, and international relations and you will join the debate on the basis of your own analysis of the different opinions of specialists in the field and your translation of Japanese primary sources. We will link the debate on Japan to wider debates including other parts of the world in order to make a comparative analysis with other societies, political systems and international political developments.

JOUR4200 is a compulsory introductory course for the students taking the MA in Journalism. It runs during the first semester.

The aim of the course is to provide an understanding of the theoretical questions and research traditions in the field of journalism. This enables students to build their further studies on solid ground and to get started straight away with the work for their final dissertation.

The course provides an introduction to the core issues in journalism research. The teaching will draw on theoretical perspectives from the existing literature, actual research, and explain how theory can be applied to empirical investigation.

Course content
Wars are not only fought on battlefields. They are also, if not foremost, battles for “hearts and minds” that take place in society before a conflict starts, during the conflict, and after it is over, in the memories and narratives about it. Communication and the media, in this respect, play a crucial role both in and outside the theatre of war.
Through this course you will explore the way the developments of communications and, in parallel with them, journalism, have, over time, affected conflicts, from the antiquity and WWII to the “war on terror.” Not only will you examine how communication technology has impacted, even driven, the way wars are fought, their very nature and scope. You will also understand the broader implications that this has for our society: the struggles waged by policy makers, journalists, the parties involved, and transnational audiences to manipulate and shape the perceptions of conflict.
This module brings together different areas of study:

Communication
Media Studies
Journalism
Politics
History

While it might take you out of your “comfort zone,” by its end you will be able to answer questions related to topical and current debates:

Are the Internet and social media “helping” terrorists?
Do global, live and instantaneous media really enable us to understand the reality of war?
Are the politicians “using” the media to “lie” to us about conflicts?
Why are we witnessing a robotization of warfare?

Ability to identify and collect data in Chinese that are necessary to answer a given research question.
Ability to assess the relevance and validity of Chinese sources.
Ability to critically reflect on the relevance of different research methodologies.

Course content
Based on the approved project description for your master thesis, you communicate in this course with your supervisor in order to decide which research methodologies are most relevant to your thesis, and which kind of data you need to collect. There is no teaching in class for this course.
Depending on your specific topic of research, data may be collected from, for instance:

literary, historical, political or other kinds of texts
interviews, participant observation, or other kinds of fieldwork
online sources, radio and TV programs, etc.

During the course, you identify and collect data that you need for your thesis work, and you read and summarize literature that critically assess the research methodologies you wish to apply.
Thus, the course has, at the same time, a practical component where you collect and describe data, and an analytical component where you reflect on your chosen methodology and practice of data collection. Therefore, the research process and the final exam paper will be of considerable use when you later write your Master thesis.

Topic Spring 2022: People, Climate and History in Pre-modern China
What was the impact of climate change on history in China? How did the Chinese historically shape their natural environment? How did they adapt to adverse climatic conditions? And which significance did the climate – in the form of a calamity or a good year – have for people? These questions will be addressed in this course focusing on the connections between people, the climate and historical developments. Our focus will be on China’s Late Imperial era (14th to 19th centuries, but especially the 17th and 18th centuries), though we will also visit both previous and later time periods through case studies and source texts. Armed with new perspectives, we will also be better able to evaluate present-day environmental problems and policies in China.
This course will enable the students to learn much about pre-modern Chinese society and about environmental history as well as how to study history and culture in China – covering source analysis, history at the level of governments and local societies, intellectual history and so on. The students will learn how to approach a variety of Classical-language sources from different genres, including historiography, diaries, local gazetteers and government documents. Evaluation will be through a term paper and an oral presentation in class.

Course content
North Korea is a society which challenges our conventional ideas about ‘development’ or ‘modernity’. While still proclaiming itself a “socialist” country (“in our style”), it relies heavily upon essentially Confucian notions of “loyalty” and “filial piety” for legitimising itself internally. Its ideology, “self-reliance” (chuch’e), represents a combination of Third- World nationalism with elements of the traditional East Asian thought.
This course is aimed at giving a coherent outline of North Korea’s development from its beginnings and until our days, in economy, society, politics and ideology. In addition, the culture of North Korea which is little known outside of the county – its literature, visual arts and cinema – will be treated as well. International relationship and their importance for North Korea’s economy, society and culture will be one more topic to focus on.

Course content
Imagine a world where everybody shares the same values; where everybody agrees on what is most important and what the good life means. Then take a look at a newspaper and count how often religion is singled out as the cause of conflicts. This course tries to make sense of what is at stake in some of these conflicts.
Religion is a contested issue across the world. However, religion is not 'one thing' but a category with unclear borders – from peaceful yogis to furious gods, holy texts and bloody sacrifice, from monotheistic to polytheistic to nontheistic religions. But everywhere religious activities – and sometimes religious beliefs – are regulated by state law. In some countries the state has allowed religion a place in the political structuring of the state, as for instance in Saudi Arabia (Wahabbi Islam) or Sri Lanka (Theravada Buddhism). Other states have opted for secularism, whether by maintaining a strict divide between the political and the religious realm (France), or by a formal commitment to treat all religions even-handedly (as in India). Yet others again keep religion under strict state control (Russia and China) or define one religion as state church (Denmark).
The international political field is increasingly regulated by norms (trade rules) and regulations (human rights), but religion is systematically excluded from international politics. This does not mean that the political role of religion has been resolved, on the contrary, as illustrated by violent blasphemy controversies across the world – from Europe (Charlie Hebdo 2015) to South Asia (Asia Bibi 2018) and the Middle East (Raif Badawi 2015).
In this course we take the state-religion nexus as a starting-point for a comparative approach to 6 topical areas (examples in parenthesis):
1. Religion and state (how laws define the religion-state nexus differently)
2. Freedom of religion – whose freedom? (cases of blasphemy)
3. Secularisation (what happens when religion is subsumed under the secular state)
4. Violence (what is special about religious extremism)
5. Religious nationalism (identity politics)
6. Majority/minority religion (problems of religious and ethnic pluralism)

In this course we will study aspects of the cultural history of magic, focusing on the period of the witch hunts in early modern Europe. The course explores how conceptions of magic, witchcraft and ‘trolldom’ changed over time; how they were put to use in philosophical reflections, demonological manuals, legislative texts, literature, as well as oral traditions; and how these ideas became social realities.

From the 1500’s, combating witchcraft with legislation and judicial prosecution became an important concern for authorities all over Europe. Witchcraft trials became a nexus between law, theology and the culture of common people. In this course, students will study the cultural and social basis of this development, and get to know a selection of Norwegian witchcraft trials. The students will also be introduced to the later redefinitions of magic expressed in modern occultism and neopaganism.

The most pressing societal challenges in the present have to do with climate change and the loss of biodiversity. In the age of the Anthropocene, nature has become a vital political concern.      
This course offers cultural historical perspectives upon the present situation. The aim is to explore how humans have used, imagined and shaped animals and physical environments and, conversely, the role that nature and ideas of nature have played in social, cultural, political, economic and everyday life.
The course focuses on ways to describe and theorise the relations between humans and nature—from early modern natural histories and the modern distinction between nature and culture, to ongoing discussions about the Anthropocene. Central themes include the politics of landscape and of domestication, the rise of conservation and scientific ecology, nature and colonialism, nature and the nation-state, and the strange new hybrid natures that emerge with the Anthropocene.

As an interdisciplinary endeavour, cognitive cultural studies are an emerging field aiming to inform the study of culture by insights and models derived from cognitive anthropology, evolutionary psychology, analytical philosophy of the mind and linguistics. This course provides a systematical introduction to the foundations and application of recent cognitive approaches to cultural analysis. Our focus is on religion and narrative, two areas of study where cognitive theorizing made a major – and quite controversial – impact. Can culture be explained?
The course covers major developments, models and debates at the interface of cognitive and cultural studies. You will be familiarised with theories and methods and learn to apply them to the analysis of historical and literary sources. Of course, we will address prominent core questions of the cognitive approaches, such as

how do we make sense of stories and why do we read fiction?
what distinguishes religious and fictional characters?
is religion a cognitive cheeseburger?
can religious thought be explained from evolutionary origins?

",,,"
Course content
Philosophy has historically had a vexed and ambivalent relationship with making and spectating images. For Plato, the question about the image is imperative to understanding the connection between the sensible world of appearances and permanent and ideal being. Ever since Plato, Western philosophy has been tackling the paradoxical status of images as situated between being and nonbeing, truth and illusion, essence and appearance. The history of philosophy abounds in debates about what images can do to us; whether they merely deceive their beholders, or are able to disclose the real and the authentic. Philosophers have questioned the relationship between image and language, between showing and telling: can images articulate and analyse the world like language does, and are their epistemic possibilities more limited? Most recently, arguments have emerged that we should consider images as forms of thought in their own right, endowed with their own agency.
This course investigates such philosophical debates about the image, starting from the questions posed in ancient Greek philosophy and spanning both modern philosophy and recent discussions in art history and visual studies. The course focuses on three areas: 1) the relationship between image and truth; 2) the relationship between image and language; 3) the notion of “pensive images,” the idea that can images act as conditions, rather than as mere supports, of thinking. The course invites students to engage in close-analysis of both philosophical texts and artistic and others kinds of images from a range of historical periods.

Course content
Technologies of light and shadow – from the camera obscura to cinema and beyond – represent a relatively recent but crucial development in the history of images. Screen-based projection, which was industrialized by the movies and is today experimented with in the gallery space, has its background in 17th-century developments in optical media, whilst the idea of capturing shadows, although as old as the history of picture-making itself, one could argue, was technically implemented by inventions in photography (“writing with light”) in the early 19th Century.
This course investigates the media history of light and shadow, situating itself within the emerging field of inquiry called “media archaeology,” which looks at the history of images and technologies, not in the sense of teleological development, but in terms of repetitions and ruptures. The course studies specific technological and conceptual turning points – from the magic lantern to chronophotography, for instance – so as to understand the recurrent forces, motives and forms of experience that have animated images for the past 500 years. It explores images of all kinds – artistic, scientific, religious, and popular. It investigates images in relation to the body and its sensations and movements as well as the mind and its concepts and imaginations, in addition to the systems of power within which these have been variously shaped.
The course requires willingness to engage in interdisciplinary study across art history, media studies and philosophy. Furthermore, the course requires students to critically reflect on their own relationship to the history of visual media – relationships that may be productive, poetic and arbitrary as much as they are disciplined, rationalised and controlled.

Course content
The most prevalent word used to describe Postmodern art and architecture is “indifference.” As in our common understanding of the word, indifference is most often used by critics as a negative and judgmental term that puts forth a certain characterization, or better yet, caricature, of Postmodernism’s ambitions and achievements.
Postmodernism’s equation with indifference is meant to criticize it in terms of its:
1) embracing a condition of neutrality suggesting lack of commitment, taking shape in various forms of irony, cynicism and nihilism;
2) a moral weakness due to a general coldness, emotional distancing and a lack of affective connectivity;
3) an aesthetic and political failure that suggests it is a form of weak relativism that eschews any particular stance, position, judgment, value, or hierarchy;
4) a general passivity, inertia, or lack of will;
5) its full-scale capitulation to the tenets of capitalism in its  emphasis on a general equivalence of things, most often characterized as a leveling or flattening of existence.
This course is meant to explore a very different and more complex sense of indifference than the negative interpretation outlined above. In doing so, it will open up a different framework for thinking about art, architecture, and urbanism of the last fifty years. Throughout the course we will look at a broad range of art and architectural examples, as well as drawing upon relevant art historical, literary, theoretical, and philosophical writings on topic.

This course will explore how visuality and aesethetics are being reconfigured within the particular forms of capitalism that dominate our time and existence, often characterized by terms such as late capitalism, absolute capitalism, capital realism, neoliberalism, and globalisation. How are issues of desire, love, sexuality, identity, ontology, connectivity, and collectivity marked by the new rhythms and intertwinings of aesthetics, visuality, and capitalism? Are the classical approaches to and categories of aesthetics and visual culture up to the task of making sense of these new reconfigurations?

Course content
The most prevalent word used to describe Postmodern art and architecture is “indifference.” As in our common understanding of the word, indifference is most often used by critics as a negative and judgmental term that puts forth a certain characterization, or better yet, caricature, of Postmodernism’s ambitions and achievements.
Postmodernism’s equation with indifference is meant to criticize it in terms of its:
1) embracing a condition of neutrality suggesting lack of commitment, taking shape in various forms of irony, cynicism and nihilism;
2) a moral weakness due to a general coldness, emotional distancing and a lack of affective connectivity;
3) an aesthetic and political failure that suggests it is a form of weak relativism that eschews any particular stance, position, judgment, value, or hierarchy;
4) a general passivity, inertia, or lack of will;
5) its full-scale capitulation to the tenets of capitalism in its  emphasis on a general equivalence of things, most often characterized as a leveling or flattening of existence.
This course is meant to explore a very different and more complex sense of indifference than the negative interpretation outlined above. In doing so, it will open up a different framework for thinking about art, architecture, and urbanism of the last fifty years. Throughout the course we will look at a broad range of art and architectural examples, as well as drawing upon relevant art historical, literary, theoretical, and philosophical writings on topic.

Spring 2021: Contemporary Issues in Visual Studies
This course will explore how visuality and aesethetics are being reconfigured within the particular forms of capitalism that dominate our time and existence, often characterized by terms such as late capitalism, absolute capitalism, capital realism, neoliberalism, and globalisation. How are issues of desire, love, sexuality, identity, ontology, connectivity, and collectivity marked by the new rhythms and intertwinings of aesthetics, visuality, and capitalism? Are the classical approaches to and categories of aesthetics and visual culture up to the task of making sense of these new reconfigurations?
In class, we will explore a broad range of visual and textual material from contemporary life and modes of thought that will help us work through these issues in compelling ways.

We will explore how habit negotiates between matter and consciousness, automatism and will, freedom and necessity, fragility and domination, activity and passivity, nature and culture. Close attention will be paid to how habit can produce different durations and dispositions that delay judgment and render us indifferent to given hierarchies of ontology, significance, and meaning.
Topics that we might address include issues of dwelling, aesthetics, ecology, animality, territory, ethics, technology/technique, repetition, mediation, objectness, rhythm, temporality, and death.

Course content
“Rome is our starting point and our point of reference,” Benito Mussolini declared in 1922: “it is our symbol or, if you wish, our Myth”.
Signs and symbols of Rome were everywhere in Fascist Italy, from the symbol of the fasces to the ‘Roman salute’. The ancient language of Rome, too, was part of the Fascist ‘cult of Rome’. Classicists composed Latin inscriptions, treatises, speeches, and poems in various genres and meters. These Latin texts glorify the most diverse aspects of Fascist Italy, including its economic organization, landscapes and archaeological sites, its imperialist agenda, and not the least its leader Mussolini.
This course offers and introduction to the Latin literature of Italian fascism (1922-1943) as well as to reading and studying these texts. We will explore these texts’ literary and rhetorical features as well as their ideological role and function in Fascist propaganda. Students are introduced to an ongoing research project (New Signs of Antiquity) and get the chance to contribute to the online edition platform Fascist Latin Texts.
The course includes co-organizing a student symposium on the subject. The symposium shall be an open event, and we may invite one or two guest speakers.

Course content
“Rome is our starting point and our point of reference,” Benito Mussolini declared in 1922: “it is our symbol or, if you wish, our Myth”.
Signs and symbols of Rome were everywhere in Fascist Italy, from the symbol of the fasces to the ‘Roman salute’. The ancient language of Rome, too, was part of the Fascist ‘cult of Rome’. Classicists composed Latin inscriptions, treatises, speeches, and poems in various genres and meters. These Latin texts glorify the most diverse aspects of Fascist Italy, including its economic organization, landscapes and archaeological sites, its imperialist agenda, and not the least its leader Mussolini.
This course offers and introduction to the Latin literature of Italian fascism (1922-1943) as well as to reading and studying these texts. We will explore these texts’ literary and rhetorical features as well as their ideological role and function in Fascist propaganda. Students are introduced to an ongoing research project (New Signs of Antiquity) and get the chance to contribute to the online edition platform Fascist Latin Texts.
The course includes co-organizing a student symposium on the subject. The symposium shall be an open event, and we may invite one or two guest speakers.

In consultation with a course teacher and the thesis supervisor, participants will further refine their project proposals for their master thesis (i.e. formulate a clearly defined research question, present an overview of relevant secondary literature, outline a theoretical framework, methodological approach, and a detailed list of relevant empirical sources). The main focus of this course will be to develop the secondary literature review. Course participants will compile their own relevant reading list. The choice of literature must provide a good general basis of information on the thesis subject of the individual student. Course participants will furthermore reflect upon which particular works constitute the key literature on their respective subjects. They will also discuss key academic debates and ‘schools’ pertaining to the academic field to which their thesis subject belongs. As far as possible, the literature review produced as part of this course will form the basis for the master’s thesis’ literature review.
The project proposal and the reading list must be approved by the course teacher and thesis supervisor. The course should normally be taken during the first year of the Master’s degree programme.

Climate change is the most serious issue facing us today. Film, media, politics, and corporations all have a powerful role in communicating the urgency of the ecological crisis. In this course we will work together to gain an overview of the complex relationship between media and the environment with a focus on UN's sustainability goals regarding “responsible production and consumption” and “climate action”. At the same time as we develop vital skills in environmental media literacy by engaging with media representations of anthropogenic ecological problems such as pollution, over-consumption and waste, we will also pay attention to resistant publics, activist groups and indigenous communities whose voices on these issues have been historically marginalised.
This course asks: how can film and media effectively convey the urgency of climate action? Together we will address how the media present the problem of, and potential solutions to, the climate crisis, while also exploring how media toxicity is part of the problem.  After all, media, smartphones and the internet appear to be ""clean and green"" but are industrial products, which can be toxic and have a substantial ecological footprint. Planned media obsolescence exacerbates the problem of E-waste by requiring consumers to purchase the latest available technology. This rapid pace of technological change has led some to reject the new and to revert to older modes of analogue media. The urgency of the climate crisis, then, requires a complete rethinking of the role of media and communication as part of the problem and part of the solution.

At the end of this course you will understand:

how the development of communications has affected over time the nature of war and the practice of war reporting.
the consequences that changes in war journalism have on the representation of war.
how changes in the perceptions of conflict can shape the outcomes of democratic debate and political mobilization.

At the end of this course you will be able to:

engage critically with both academic research and contemporary public debates by identifying and examining contradictions and problematic issues.
evaluate and compare arguments validity by drawing evidence from case studies.
explain and defend your ideas on the subject (through presentations, participation to discussions in seminars, essay writing).

Course content
The course will not be taught the spring semester of 2022.
Wars are not only fought on battlefields. They are also, if not foremost, battles for “hearts and minds” that take place in society before a conflict starts, during the conflict, and after it is over, in the memories and narratives about it. Communication and the media, in this respect, play a crucial role both in and outside the theatre of war.
Through this course you will explore the way the developments of communications and, in parallel with them, journalism, have, over time, affected conflicts, from the antiquity and WWII to the “war on terror.” Not only will you examine how communication technology has impacted, even driven, the way wars are fought, their very nature and scope.  You will also understand the broader implications that this has for our society: the struggles waged by policy makers, journalists, the parties involved, and transnational audiences to manipulate and shape the perceptions of conflict.
This module brings together different areas of study:

Communication
Media Studies
Journalism
Politics
History.

While it might take you out of your “comfort zone,” by its end you will be able to answer questions related to topical and current debates:

Are the internet and social media “helping” terrorists?
Do global, live and instantaneous media really enable us to understand the reality of war?
Are the politicians “using” the media to “lie” to us about conflicts?
Why are we witnessing a robotization of warfare?

",,,"
Course content
What do we know and what do we not know about time and temporality? 
The course Audiovisual Media Temporalities: Temporality in Films, Series, Games and Social Media is a theoretical and analytical inquiry into different audiovisual media temporalities.
“What is time?”, Saint Augustine asked in his Confessions. “Who can explain this easily and briefly? Who can comprehend this even in thought so as to articulate the answer in words? Yet what do we speak of, in our familiar everyday conversation, more than of time? We surely know what we mean when we speak of it. We also know what is meant when we hear someone else talking about it. What then is time? Provided that no one asks me, I know. If I want to explain it to an inquirer, I do not know.”
These questions and observations made about 1600 years ago are seemingly timeless, still of relevance to our contemporary understanding of time and temporality. In this course, we ask ourselves what kinds of times and temporalities are found in films, series, games and social media, and explore particular audiovisual media texts through theoretically informed close analyses.
In order to suggest answers to such questions, we will look at and listen attentively and analytically to audiovisual media texts, such as The Simpsons, Twin Peaks: The Return, Joachim Trier’s “Oslo Trilogy” (Reprise, Oslo, August 31, The Worst Person in the World), and Facebook.

Critically evaluate and analyze media innovation as a multi-dimensional phenomenon

",,,"
Course content
Innovation is one of the key terms of our current era. We all know the imperative: to innovate, change, disrupt, transform, make new - all in the service of new business opportunities, technologies, efficiency, and progress. In this course we will critically interrogate this concept, asking what innovation is or can be, and examining how innovation is practiced and who is recognizable as an innovator. Why has it become a dominant way of conceptualizing organizational and cultural transformation in the 21st century? Why do we often think of innovation in terms of new, shiny objects or new technologies? What ways of living and making are marginalized in mainstream ideas of innovation? 
The main aim of this course is to encourage students to question assumptions about the nature, actors, practices, actors and locations of innovations. It will do so by exploring what the technological, creative and innovative might mean, and who or what gets to be part of those definitions, studying a wide range of examples from the media sector, including TV, journalism, and the cultural industries. The course will draw on perspectives from science and technology studies (STS), organizational studies, sociology, anthropology and design, human-computer interaction (HCI), as well as media and communication studies.

Course content
The media sector is undergoing significant changes and are increasingly affected by massive advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and how people interact with the internet. Digitalization in general and AI in particular are challenging the business model of established media companies, and in what way companies should deliver and design new media services. New innovations are needed for a media sector that is viable in economic and democratic terms.
The course MEVIT4311 - AI Innovations and chatbots will help you understand and assess innovations in the media sector with a particular focus on the latest developments within AI and chatbots. You will learn to evaluate innovation strategies, and to suggest new innovation strategies for companies. A practical task will be to develop and innovate a new chatbot service. You will learn to evaluate how people experience this chatbot and to analyse what motivates future use of chatbots in terms of user needs. Chatbots is a derivative of “chat robots,” understood as machine agents that serve as natural language user interfaces to data and services through text or voice.
In this course, we address media innovations from three interrelated perspectives:

The relationships between technological development and media innovations with a particular focus on AI and chatbots 
The relationships between media management and media innovations
Audiences, society, power and media innovations: The personal, social and societal consequences of media innovations in the context of AI.

Theories of strategic communication and lobbying, and the relationship to politics and democracy
The historical development of lobbying in the Nordic region
In what way social actors use news media and social media to influence politics 
How to write a theoretical or empirical analysis about how strategic communication impacts the political decision-making process

",,,"
Course content
This course will focus on the strategic communication of the social actors that seek influence in the political realm. Organized interests like businesses, nongovernmental organisations, trade associations and unions have a stake in how policies are formed and implemented. To this end, they will seek to influence politicians and bureaucrats directly and indirectly.
The Nordic region has been characterized by so-called corporatism, whereby some actors have institutionalised privileged access to politicians and the political decision-making process. Over the last few decades, however, lobbying has been seen to substitute or supplement corporatist arrangements. The course addresses the lobbying strategies and techniques used to impact the political agenda, understandings of issues, and, ultimately, political decisions. The implications for democracy of such activities are discussed, focusing on how deliberation can be improved through this process, but also how certain interests might prevail over others.
Questions that are raised include:

What is strategic communication, lobbying and corporatism?
What is the historical background for the link between strategic communication and politics?
Do some interests have undue political influence on the democratic process through strategic communication?
Can better policy outcomes be delivered by the provision of expertise that decision-makers lack?
What communication strategies are used by lobbyists?
What role is played by news media and social media?

",,,"
Course content
In this course, we will critically investigate how we, as individuals, communities and societies, talk about immigration. In doing so, we will also go beyond the level of debates and discourse, and address the important ways in which what we talk about, and how we talk about it, shapes our social reality. We will begin with well-known theoretical perspectives on the public sphere, media framing and agenda setting, and partisanship and political discourse, which will provide an overview of the dominant ways in which media scholarship views and understands immigration debates. From there, we will explore the limitations of these approaches, and explore immigration debates from the ground up. In doing so, we will pay particular attention to perspectives that are excluded from dominant debates, such as the lived experiences of migrants living in contemporary Western societies. Throughout the course, these more theoretical discussions will be interwoven with methodological discussions about the benefits and limitations of different methodological approaches, when addressing contentious topics such as immigration in contemporary society. We will also critically reflect on the ethical and normative position of the researcher in studying issues related to racism, discrimination and ‘othering’ practices.
Each week, students will engage with a range of provided online materials, after which they will work on tutorial tasks in their online teams. This course requires students to critically engage with current issues, and to actively participate in group and debate activities. Throughout the course, students will work on a comparative research project, in which they will get first-hand experience about the implications of particular methodological choices and their own positioning as a media researcher.

What is journalism in an age when anyone, in principle can be a reporter? What is the role of journalists in contemporary society? This course aims to challenge the cliches and commonplace assumptions we often hear about journalism in a democracy, particularly the notion that journalists are “independent” and “objective.” We will, in fact, explore the way in which news is constructed and how both journalists and media organizations, inescapably, operate under a range of social and political influences. We will question the notions of “truth” and what it means, in practice, to be “ethical.” Among other topics, we will also explore journalism outside the Western world. In doing so we will compare the definitions and assumptions about journalism we can find in textbooks and in research within Journalism Studies to the actual practice of journalists working in the field, struggling with deadlines, shrinking budgets, precarious contracts and many other constraints.
 
Please note: This is not a course teaching you how to work as a journalist. However, it includes empirical case studies and research on the practice of journalism, particularly the way journalists’ routines and decisions are taken in concrete situations.

Course content
Chances are you are reading this course description on a screen, just as you are likely to – if you decide to join – enroll using a screen. If you are accepted, confirmation will be sent to you via email or text message, accessed on a screen. In the meantime, you may have checked out the news or your social media feed on your laptop or a watched a video or played a game on your smart watch. Perhaps you just glanced at the information boards whilst waiting for your train. You get it: we live our lives through screens. But this begs the question: during all that screen time, what do we see?
In this course you study how screens communicate their content – which includes considering how the latter is reliant on the former – to their users. It is interested in the ways in which screens engage us, talk to us and with us, taking into account questions of materiality, narrative and narration, style and meaning, tone, and genre. A desktop computer will organize the material you are currently reading differently from a smart phone screen, after all, just as a television screen affords and limits engagements with a film that your watch doesn’t. Do a glossy photograph and an oil painting on canvas refer to the same reality? Similarly, each of these engagements implies a distinct context: the desktop requires electricity, a desk, and a room with a roof, just as what you watch on your phone is, as everyone who has mistakenly watched an episode of Game of Thrones in a crowded bus is aware, dependent on where you find yourself. In other words: how do screens look?

Learning outcome
Screen Politics students will acquire a critical understanding of:

Theories of subjectivity and the self, as well as their political dimensions.
Theories of and approaches to screen media and their political implications.
Theories of politics and political communication and how they intertwine with the above.

Screen Politics students will further learn:

How to independently analyse and interpret media texts and cultural artefacts pertaining to the political dimensions of screens and the individual as well as institutional practices and the cultures surrounding them.

",,,"
Course content
In Screen Politics we will focus on the political dimensions of our relations and interactions with screens. Screen relations are often intimate and private and appear to be far removed from broader social and political concerns. However, as we will learn, it is in the very intimacy afforded by our screens that they unfold their political powers. Screens both provide and prohibit access to our global realities and affect all aspects of everyday life. They do so by making these provisions and prohibitions seem natural, making that which becomes afforded real and that which drops from sight non-existent. They shape our behaviours and set frames for our expectations.
Television series such as Netflix’s Bodyguard (2018), for example, address us as people for whom an omnipresent danger of terrorism has become the norm. As another example, even a mundane gesture, such as Tinder’s ‘swipe’, which turns dating into an efficiently binary selection process, has political implications in the way that it teaches us something about how to ‘deal with’ other people.
The course will shed light on, and delve increasingly deeper into, processes such as the above. It will do so in three consecutive, interrelated steps, presenting and discussing:

theories of subjectivity, society and the political,
		 
the politics of screens (i.e. how our screens and the ways in which they are given to us as nodes, platforms and interfaces grant or bar us from accessing services and enacting rights and responsibilities), and
		 
the politics on screens (i.e. the politics of representation and participation in the news and other genres)

When the internship/course is finished the student is expected to know how

to work relatively independently in the professional context of the respective partnering institution.
to demonstrate advanced knowledge of this professional context.
to formulate professional/institutional/practical/ethical/design/etc. challenges pertaining to the partnering institution in a way that also meets scientific standards.
to write a report on (at least one and up to three of) these challenges, with clearly delimited object(s) of knowledge and sound scientific reference technique.
to search for and understand scientific literature pertaining to the work done during the internship.
to account for and discuss this literature in an independent and critical matter.

 
",,,"
Course content
This course is intended for students in the Screen Cultures MA programme who would like to combine an internship at an outside institute, corporation, or other partnering institution with an elective course unit (10 ECTS). It is specifically designed to afford students the possibility to reflect on the work experience gathered during their internship, prompting them to delve into the respective professional context but also retaining a measure of academic and analytical distance. The aim is for students not only to become highly involved in the partnering institution’s work processes, but also to take an analytic perspective on such routine workflows, which are seldom inquired into on a day-to-day basis. In this two-pronged way, we hope both the claim to first-hand work experience and the demands of academic standards are satisfied.
The internship course should be the equivalent of a 10 ECTS course unit, which amounts to max. 250 workhours in total.

",,,"
Course content
Of what importance are the histories and theories of screens for understanding our current screen cultures? Screens are now a dominant presence and interface in culture in a number of ways. Screens are no longer defined by their institutional location (the cinema, the living room, the office) but are ubiquitous. They come across as various types and scales, from mobile phones and video games to virtual realities. We carry screens with us, devote our attention to them, navigate our behaviors with them. In return, screens disclose worlds more beautiful and desirable than ours beneath their surface, capturing us into cycles of dreamy consumption. 

This course explores the historical background of current developments in screen-based media. The course looks at the more or less distant past so as to make sense of what is happening at the present, and to come up with critical conceptual tools to understand the various workings of screens – ranging from sites of spectacle and scientific vision machines to the noisy surfaces that fill today’s lived environments. The manifold culture of screens didn’t begin with the introduction of cinema, but its history extends much further, to nineteenth-century panoramas and magic lantern spectacles as well as seventeenth-century camera obscuras, among many other things. This course investigates such a “deep time” of screens. It charts critical moments from the early modern period to the present – moments that involve technological developments as well as cultural and political changes – as well as their diverse theoretical interpretations.

",,,"
Course content
MITRA4300 – Global Encounters 1850 - 2010 - Transnational Movements of People, Ideas and Commodities starts from the premise that there is no global history that is not also economic history. While a well-known feature of pre-modern societies, the exchange of goods, people, and ideas greatly accelerated and multiplied over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, though with periods of stagnation and retreat. We now distinguish between a ‘first globalisation’ era in the age of imperialism on the one hand and a second wave which set in after World War II. However, these are only rough markers: different parts of the world did not experience the same patterns and dynamics while segmentation and tighter border controls have been simultaneous developments in many parts for the world.
The course focuses on these nonlinear dynamics and investigates the intersection of the movement of goods, people, and ideas: it thus spans business and trade history, migration and labour history, consumption and the global circulation of economic ideas. And given that all global history is local the course will illustrate large trends by drawing on precise examples.
The course is divided into three major blocks: (A) people and migration, (B) companies and commodities, and (C) ideas. Block A will follow the shifting waves of migration – seasonal, labour, exile – first out of Europe and then back, but will also investigate very different phenomena such as tourism. Block B sets out to delineate how today’s global division of resources, labour, and riches has emerged over the course of the past 200 years, deeply entangled with great power politics, and has led to a situation in which social and economic standards differ vastly while at the same time consumerism has increasingly shed national particularities. Block C shall discuss the evolution and dissemination of important economic theories which have shaped the way national economies as well as global markets have been run, e.g. free trade, Malthusianism, the growth paradigm, or ecological concerns.

This course gives a thorough introduction to theories of multilingualism, from both an historical and contemporary perspective. Starting with foundational studies on bilingual acquisition and early systematic approaches to multilingualism at the individual and societal levels, and language maintenance and shift, we will introduce both psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives in research on multilingualism. When Linguistics emerged as a field from the 1920s, the focus was primarily on monolingualism, though advances in Linguistic Anthropology, Sociolinguistics, and Language Acquisition brought about a stronger focus on, and more systematic study of, variation and diversity. The course will shed light on how Multilingualism emerged and gradually consolidated as a research field, and identify areas in which Sociolinguistics and Psycholinguistics share research interests, such as language acquisition, code-switching, and language and emotions.

",,,"
Course content
How does gender affect the way we relate to music?
A wide range of musical genres, intellectual traditions and research methods will be explored to address this question in the course.
We will look at the different ways that binary (male-female) ideas of gender are expressed and reinforced in musical communities.
We will also juxtapose traditional ideas of conceiving and staging gender identities with instances where music participants have rebelled against, or at least challenged such norms and practices.
The course will introduce students to the exciting range of actors that they can critically engage with: from unknown Baroque composers and their instruments, to transgender DJs and their music hardware; from students in the school music classroom, to female-only music festivals and the marketing of sexuality in pop music.
Students will learn about an equally large range of conceptual frames for studying gender and music, including, for example, the musical canon and feminist historiography and analysis, queer and postcolonial theories.
In engaging with this rich, complex, and generative field of sources and ideas, this course aims to equip students with a broad conceptual and methodological vocabulary to make sense of the multiple issues at stake in music and gender, and to articulate these effectively.

Popular Music and Dust: Archives, Memory, Heritage, Historiography​
This course is about the politics and practices of popular music archives.
What is an archive, and what can be found there? What kinds of popular music are collected and recollected, preserved and presented? Who makes these decisions, on what grounds, with what means, and to what ends? And how may we utilize archival research in the study of popular music?
We will engage with foundational and contemporary archival theory, as well as histories of popular music archiving and their relationship to popular music historiography. We will look at official archives as well as grassroots initiatives that preserve popular music heritage. We will discuss the challenges of collecting, curating, and interpreting various kinds of popular music artifacts—with special attention to questions of digitization and the difficulties of archiving online cultural forms. We will pay attention to the politics of collection and display in archives and museums with regard to social inequalities (e.g. gender, sexuality, ethnicity, race, colonialism, disability).

",,,"
Course content
Developed in close collaboration with the Norwegian National Opera, this course seeks to introduce students to the practices and possibilities of stage interpretation in opera. Students will be invited into the opera house in order to gain a critical understanding of how meaning is created in the rehearsal room. Having actively observed the work of interpretation in the course of rehearsals in the opera house, students will in turn be asked to formulate their own conceptual approaches to a given work. No prior experience in opera direction is expected, but a keen interest in the nature of artistic interpretation and a willingness to think expansively, creatively, and rigorously about how meaning-making transpires in artistic practice is required.
We will discuss a broad range of materials, encompassing musicological works that offer insight into the specific opera being staged, to more theoretical work (encompassing theatre practice, social theory, textual theory, and/or media theory) on theatrical interpretation and performance practice.
By investigating some of the historical, technological, and aesthetic discourses surrounding opera and opera production, this course aims to clarify some of the ways in which opera functions as a living art form, shaped by and shaping contemporary sensibilities, informed by and in turn informing the way we understand and experience the world.

Course content
What is the relationship between music and the environment? Music has been thought of as “the sound of circulation in Nature’s veins” and likened to “the clutter of the unkempt forest.” It has evoked breathtaking landscapes and voiced environmentalist criticism. But music has also contributed to noise pollution, and it has generated tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, music has always been a significant exploiter of both natural and human resources.
This course is about the history of musical thought and scholarship on the environment. It is equally about the history, current state, and future of the relationship between music and the environment. We will learn about foundational fields such as acoustic ecology and soundscape studies as well as emerging fields such as ecomusicology and the environmental humanities. We will place special emphasis on the material realities that constitute the very possibility of making music or listening to it—including issues such as deforestation and electric guitars, gendered labor and mica mining, forced labor and electronics assembly, electrical grids and social inequality, pollution and concertgoing, resource extraction and recording formats.
None of these realities take away from the beauty and goodness of music in certain contexts. They do, however, suggest that if we are serious about understanding the full extent of music’s involvement in the circumstances of thriving and suffering in this world, and if we truly want to intervene in those circumstances, then we have to confront the relationship between music and the environment in all its complexity. It is only then that we might develop a musicology in the future tense, which may lead toward post-catastrophic musical cultures.

",,,"
Course content
How does gender affect the way we relate to music?
A wide range of musical genres, intellectual traditions and research methods will be explored to address this question in the course.
We will look at the different ways that binary (male-female) ideas of gender are expressed and reinforced in musical communities.
We will also juxtapose traditional ideas of conceiving and staging gender identities with instances where music participants have rebelled against, or at least challenged such norms and practices.
The course will introduce students to the exciting range of actors that they can critically engage with: from unknown Baroque composers and their instruments, to transgender DJs and their music hardware; from students in the school music classroom, to female-only music festivals and the marketing of sexuality in pop music.
Students will learn about an equally large range of conceptual frames for studying gender and music, including, for example, the musical canon and feminist historiography and analysis, queer and postcolonial theories.
In engaging with this rich, complex, and generative field of sources and ideas, this course aims to equip students with a broad conceptual and methodological vocabulary to make sense of the multiple issues at stake in music and gender, and to articulate these effectively.

address open questions in the relationship between the state and civil society from many historical and theoretical viewpoints

",,,"
Course content
This course will directly address the complex nature of the politics and society of contemporary Iran to gain an oversight of its dynamic, internal dimensions and how they link with the country’s regional and extra-regional relations. Covering a range of approaches from Politics, Sociology, Comparative Politics, Visual Arts, and Anthropology, among others, “Iran in the World” addresses the evolving positions of modern Iran through weekly thematic discussions on its dynamics pertaining to politics, economy, identity, culture, religion and security. Engaging interdisciplinary scholarship, readings will highlight the tensions between state and civil society and the influence and involvement of regional politics and global networks, starting with the Qajar dynasty in the 19th century to its present status as an Islamic Republic. Iran will be framed as a vibrant country with rich and interrelated historical, political, cultural and religious contexts.
 
We will examine the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925; the nationalization of oil by nationalist reformer Mossadeq; the development of the heterogeneous opposition movement against the Pahlavi regime; the occurrence of the “Islamic” Revolution of 1979; and finally, its more than four-decade long transformation into a post-revolutionary political system and regional power.

After having followed this course, you will have:

learned about important media issues and trends in the Middle East
evaluated the role media play in Middle Eastern culture and politics, in relation to specific historical events
familiarized yourself with a growing and diverse body of literature and scholarship and a variety of approaches to studying Arab media
read, watched and analysed examples of media content from the Arabic mediascape in Arabic or in translation
addressed open questions related to the mass media and Middle East, such as questions of access, gender, censorship, cultural and political change. 

",,,"
Course content
This course will explore the role of mass media in the Middle East and their impact on society and cultural debates. The course is designed to assist students in understanding the evolving mass communication media in the Middle East, with an emphasis on Arabic language media. It draws on existing scholarship in the field of history, literature, social sciences, popular culture and visual cultures, and it privileges a historical and cultural approach. Indeed, the implementation of digital media, that has attracted much academic attention in the last decade, will be studied as the last development of a longer media history that dates back to the 9th century. We will start with the transition from oral to script culture that took place in the Abbasid period and its effect on knowledge production; we will proceed with analysing the spread of print technologies after several centuries of a flourishing manuscript culture in the 19th century; the emergence of audio-visual media (radio, TV, film) in the 20th century; we will conclude with the emergence of Internet technology in the 21st century.
Students will be exposed to and engage in discussions about various media theories, issues, forms and practices. A broad range of topics will be covered including the history and development of the Arab press, the role played by radio and television in the national-building process, the relationship between cinema and literature, the rise of satellite television and the Al-Jazeera phenomenon, and the advent of digital media. Media will be analysed in relation to the rise of specific genres, such as cultural journalism, soap operas, reality shows, autofictional blogs and YouTube comedies. Special attention will be paid to the role that media has played in the momentous changes which shook the region, such as the 1919 revolution in Egypt and the Arab Spring uprising. Equally of interest is the relationship between media and language, questions of access and gender, and how media practitioners deal with censorship and authoritarian regimes.
The teaching will be focused on Arabic language media, but alternative readings may be arranged for students interested in Persian or Turkish-language media.

The primary objective of the course is to familiarise students with the main political and cultural features of early modern Islamic empires from the Balkans to Bengal, and to realise that they represent much more than a stagnant backwater waiting to be expanded upon by Europeans.
The secondary perspective is to provide students with a historical depth that can be used to contextualise contemporary legitimacy claims and the use of imperial history in political discussions. The course does this by providing students with in-depth knowledge of a rich Islamic tradition that shaped and brought together a wide geographic area – one that is markedly different from what is typically emphasised in courses on political Islam.
After having followed this course, you will have:

gained familiarity with the main developments and institutions of the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal empires
acquired a grasp of historiographical and social-scientific approaches for explaining the rise and fall of early modern Islamic empires
understand how these empires legitimised their rule
acquired the knowledge and tools you need to understand what ties these empires together historically, and to see contemporary politics in light of these commonalities

",,,"
Course content
What is today the Middle East, Balkans, Caucasus, Central Asia, Pakistan and India was long dominated by Islamic empires, who shared many cultural reference points, texts, technologies and techniques of ruling. In this course students learn about the main features of early modern Islamic empires, with an emphasis on the Ottomans, Safavids and Mughals.
While the Ottoman polity emerged in Anatolia in 1299, and rose to prominence in the fifteenth century, both the Safavids and Mughals came to power in Iran and northern India respectively in the early sixteenth century. Emphasising the interconnectedness of this part of the world, the circulation of scribes, intellectuals and artists, and also the war-making practices of these three polities, the course tries to give students a historical depth of understanding of the dynamism and flexibility of these Islamic polities before European hegemony.

The course covers altogether 10-12 films that range from art films to popular genre films. The films covered are directed by well-established as well as up-and-coming filmmakers from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, including Joachim Trier, Iram Haq, Lars von Trier, Susanne Bier, Roy Andersson, Ruben Östlund, and Aki Kaurismäki. Students will learn to analyze and compare these films from a thematic and aesthetic perspective.

“Rome is our starting point and our point of reference,” Benito Mussolini declared in 1922: “it is our symbol or, if you wish, our Myth”.
Signs and symbols of Rome were everywhere in Fascist Italy, from the symbol of the fasces to the ‘Roman salute’. The ancient language of Rome, too, was part of the Fascist ‘cult of Rome’. Classicists composed Latin inscriptions, treatises, speeches, and poems in various genres and meters. These Latin texts glorify the most diverse aspects of Fascist Italy, including its economic organization, landscapes and archaeological sites, its imperialist agenda, and not the least its leader Mussolini.
This course offers and introduction to the Latin literature of Italian fascism (1922-1943) as well as to reading and studying these texts. We will explore these texts’ literary and rhetorical features as well as their ideological role and function in Fascist propaganda. Students are introduced to an ongoing research project (New Signs of Antiquity) and get the chance to contribute to the online edition platform Fascist Latin Texts.
The course includes co-organizing a student symposium on the subject. The symposium shall be an open event, and we may invite one or two guest speakers.

Course content
Buddhism has adapted to rapid economic, social, cultural, and political transformations in the modern, post-modern, and globalized world.
Since its inception in India in the sixth century BC, Buddhism spread – first throughout Asia, and then globally in the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
Buddhism has shown a remarkable flexibility and an ability to co-exist with a variety of social structures as it spread, not only to farming and herding communities, but also to highly complex Asian and Western urban societies.
In the West, the popularity of Buddhism was inspired by the academic study of Asian worldviews, the romanticism of Orientalism, the Beat-generation of the 1950s, the hippies of the 1960s, and the contemporary New Age-movement, as well as by Asian migration to the West. Buddhists work, not only for world peace, but also for increased social engagement, ecological awareness, and gender equality.
At the same time, both in the past and in the contemporary world, Buddhists have encouraged to, and engaged in, armed conflicts and wars. This class covers, with a thematic and regional focus, such modern Buddhist developments.

Topic spring 2022: Social and religious change
Why are religions so different, and how do they reflect the societies they are a part of? How do they change, overlap and influence one another?
The purpose of the course is to enhance the students' understanding of the intimate and complex relationship between religion and society. Critical approaches to the study of religion treat religions as multiple and historically contingent. The emphasis is on the dynamic aspects of religion, in religiously diverse societies and societies undergoing profound cultural changes around the world and in different historical periods. Recurrent topics are, e.g., questions of magic, authority, power, body, gender, ethnicity, and identity. The course material covers a variety of methodological tools and theoretical perspectives, and the students learn how to connect them to data. Through case studies reaching from pagan and Christian Vikings to headhunters in Borneo and New Age entrepreneurs in Arizona, the students learn to analyze various cultural, political and social aspects of religion in a global, comparative perspective.

Course content
Human rights ideas and norms have been increasingly operationalized through the actions of diverse actors such as states, multi-lateral organisations, social movements, NGOs and community groups. Operationalistion takes place therefore across different kinds of activist, professional and institutional spaces. How and when these abstract norms encounter messy ‘real world’ practicalities of organisational, social, economic, political and cultural contexts, though posing many dilemmas, has in general received limited reflection. Obvious cases in point are how and why certain human rights issues and approaches are prioritized over others, by whom, and to what end and, in particular, what effect. Better critical multi-disciplinary experience and assessment of human rights practice and practitioners can enhance awareness of these challenges especially in addressing the problematic issue of therefore what creates change and the diversity of impact in human rights interventions.
 
With many graduates from the programme Theory and Practice of Human Rights (master's two years) seeking to work in the human rights field, exposure to the daily mechanics of ‘human rights practice’ is beneficial through student-led active learning:

to develop critical thinking, insight and ‘hands on’ understanding by doing human rights practice;
during the semester: to create a series of student-led advocacy seminars as a ‘mini-human rights organization’. Students organise these workshops in relation to one case selected each semester in partnership Scholars at Risk, with each stage being a component in developing the advocacy intervention
after the semester: an internship will further develop practical employment-related skills and hands-on experience of practice.

Course content
Thise course is discontinued, we offer the possibility to take the examination last time spring 2018.
Both the moral idea of human rights and the system of international legal human rights play an increasingly important role in both domestic and international affairs. At the same time, because of this increasing influence, human rights have met with resistance and demands for justification.
This course will combine two lines of inquiry into human rights: First, it will study the role international human rights play, the influence they have, and the resistance they are met with by different kinds of political regime. Next, it will address the legitimacy of human rights and examine how human rights can be justified and what the task of justifying human rights amounts to.
The course will show how these lines of inquiry are related by examining the increasing emphasis in the philosophical literature on human rights on the need to begin the task of justification by establishing a proper concept of human rights, something which can best be done by paying close attention to the actual practice of human rights.

Course content
The catalogue of human rights and their use in public discourse has expanded considerably over the last decades. This expansion process and related controversies are discussed and analyzed at length in scholarly writing in different fields, including law, philosophy, and political sciences. The controversies and competing interests of different stakeholders are evident in the legal and political demands of individuals, States, and non-State actors.
Based on a selection of topics, this course sets out to examine how certain rights and protections for certain categories of persons have emerged, have been interpreted and have been applied in practice.
The focus will be on a selection of civil and political rights, socio-economic rights, collective rights, and extra-territorial rights which generate considerable controversies in their practical application. Each selected topic will be presented through a multi-disciplinary method. This presentation will involve establishing the historical and political background of the specific right, assessing philosophical debates and problematiques, examining its recognition and interpretation in international and comparative law, and assessing its broader interpretation and application in practice. Due attention will also be devoted to potential and actual conflicts between different rights.

Course content
The rise of contemporary economic globalisation has changed traditional discussions on the duties of businesses to increasingly being framed in terms of human rights and in a transnational and global manner. Yet, in spite of growing support for the idea that businesses should respect human rights, it is still far from having global acceptance and recognition.
This course addresses recent developments in linking business practices and human rights (including corporate social responsibility (CSR)) within the UN and in other international organisations, and focusses on the efforts in making human rights an important normative framework for the conduct of business in different societal and political contexts. It offers arguments in favor of and against extending human rights to the corporate sector, and discusses legal developments, including normative and remedial mechanisms. It examines strengths and weaknesses of the CSR movement and the scope for making human rights regulatory measures for corporate behavior. The students will study practical cases of CSR policies of selected companies in a variety of contexts.

The course will provide the students with an understanding of some of the main philosophical debates about human rights, concerning how the concept of human rights should be understood, how human rights can be justified and the moral relevance of human rights. After having taken the course the student will be able to critically participate in these debates and will have the foundation for understanding new questions arising within the philosophy of human rights.
",,,"
Course content
While the concept of human rights today plays an important role both in law and in politics (domestic and international), it is also a concept which is firmly grounded in philosophical discussions of rights, in at least two ways. On the one hand, there is a long philosophical tradition discussing rights in general, and natural rights in particular, and which is arguably a precursor of the contemporary concept of human rights. On the other hand, the philosophy of human rights has in the last decade seen a turn away from the natural rights tradition and towards examining and providing a philosophical justification for the contemporary practice of human rights, in particular as this practice takes place in international law and politics. 
Indeed, one of the main topics of discussion within the contemporary philosophy of human rights is whether human rights are best understood according to the so-called “orthodox” or “naturalistic” approach, where human rights are seen as belonging inherently to the natural rights tradition in philosophy, or according to the so-called “political” or “practical approach”, according to which the philosophy of human rights must take as its point of departure the role human rights actually play in contemporary politics, with the result that human rights might turn out to be quite different from natural rights. The course will cover both approaches to human rights, examining the merits of each approach, and discussing what is at stake in the debate between orthodox and political approaches to the philosophy of human rights. 
In addition to discussing the question of how the concept of human rights should be understood, the course will also discuss other core questions in the philosophy of human rights, such as how human rights claims can be justified, the role human rights play in normative theory, how to deal with conflicts of rights, the relationship between moral human rights and legal human rights, and the relation between human rights and relativism. The course will also examine how the debate over different concepts of human rights is relevant for the discussion of these further questions. Finally, the course will address the legitimacy of the international human rights system and consider moral criticisms of this system.

Course content
This course addresses different ways of thinking about the relationship between development and human rights, and addresses critical contemporary issues as global and local poverty, national and global inequalities and environmental challenges. It discusses shifts over time in the conceptualisation of development and examines the increasingly more central place of human rights in the development discourse, as expressed in ideas about “development as freedom”, “rights-based development” and the “right to development” as a human right. It addresses the recent discourses on linkages between sustainable development and human rights, in view of new trends in globalization. It also explores the role of institutions (local, national and international) in safeguarding human rights (or the opposite, as obstacles to rights protection). The course gives scope for discussing the relationship between economic policies for social justice through human rights lenses, while also presenting selected legal cases and constitutional references on the right to development, and legal protection in development contexts.
The course offers critical examinations of practices of international development agencies, as appropriated by civil society, and thorough the application of a rights based approach to selected human rights issues, notably, poverty, health, climate change and land polices.

On completion of this course, the student should be able to:

Identify sources of regulation that are applicable to international business transactions: international conventions, national law, commercial practices and other forms of “soft law”;
Evaluate the extent to which the parties may derogate from the above mentioned rules in their contracts;
Understand the mechanisms of choice of forum and choice of law, permitting to identify the law applicable to the contract;
Appreciate the effectiveness of these rules in case the parties have chosen to submit any dispute regarding their transaction to international arbitration.

Course content
The course aims at providing an understanding of the legal framework that governs international business transactions. The parties are not completely free to regulate their relationship or to ensure that the transaction is governed by a set of rules fully agreeable to them. This course explains how the legal framework restricts the parties’ freedom to contract in an international context. It gives therefore the tools to properly appreciate how far the drafting of an international contract may go, as well as to evaluate whether a claim based on an international contract is likely to be enforceable according to its terms or not.
Students are expected to take active part in the course, since a part of the course will be dedicated to case studies.

Course content
The course examines the competition rules of the European Union; particularly the competition rules concerning undertakings in Articles 101-106 TFEU.
Competition law is the rules which regulate private firms' market conduct, in order to prevent anti-competitive effects on the markets and thereby to maintain efficient competition. Competition law contains three ""pillars"": prohibition of anti-competitive agreements (the ""cartel prohibition""), prohibition of abuse of market power (the ""abuse prohibition"") and regulation of mergers and take-overs (""Merger Control""). These rules are supplemented both by other Treaty provisions as well as secondary legislation. The rules are of great significance since any firm may be subject to heavy fines and/or liability for damages if infringing them. The maximum fine for infringement may be as high as 10% of a firm's annual turnover.
The European Commission plays an active part in enforcing the competition rules, and a study of Competition Law is therefore also a study of EU Administrative Law. This area of Law also gives the student a good opportunity to study the interrelation between Law and economics, since these legal norms often are based on economic theory.
Students need no former knowledge of EU Law before taking this course, but it may require some additional reading.
Students are expected to take an active part in the course since the emphasis is placed upon seminars and discussion groups rather than formal lectures. Students must also be prepared to give presentations to the rest of the group.

Course content
The course provides an in-depth study of the regulation of the energy sector from an international, European and Norwegian perspective.
Energy law covers the regulation of and access to energy resources, energy markets – both physical and financial - and the regulation of energy use. For the purpose of this course, energy law is understood in the broad sense of the term, and both oil, gas and electricity will be covered. The four stages of production, transport, supply and consumption are included, with a focus on upstream and midstream activities.
The course is structured in four parts. Part I provides an introduction to the general legal concepts and principles applicable to energy activities, such as: sovereignty over natural resources, jurisdiction delimitation, ownership and exploitation models, and resources management mechanisms. Part II reviews the key components of the Norwegian model for the regulation of upstream oil and gas activities, including the licensing system, the Joint Operation Agreement, the coordination of petroleum activities at field level through unitisation and joint development, the regime for upstream gas transportation and third party access. It also covers the environmental regulation of petroleum activities. Part III is dedicated to the regulation of electricity generation (hydropower and other sources, onshore and offshore) and transmission/distribution in Norway as well as connection to the European market. This parts includes a review of the applicable European Union (EU) energy market legislation and its implementation in Norway through the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement. Part IV deals with energy trading, both upstream gas sales and wholesale electricity trading, with a review of relevant EU/EEA competition rules, internal energy market legislation and commercial practices in Norway and on the Nordic power market. Supply and energy consumption aspects are covered to a more limited extend.

This course is designed to provide students with a broad introduction to some of the key substantive policy areas of the European internal market. . An understanding of the EU Internal Market will be developed by studying the evolution from a common market to an internal market and by focussing on two of its key components: the free movement of goods and the free movement of persons.
The free movement of goods is one of the ‘four freedoms’ of the European Union. The creation of an internal (often referred to as the single) market, which is one of the central tasks of the EU, is defined as ‘an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty’ (Article 26 TFEU). In order to achieve this, any obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital, as between Member States must be abolished. In particular relation to goods, this necessarily involves the prohibition, as between Member States, of customs duties and quantitative restrictions on the import and export of goods, and all other measures having equivalent effect. In addition to creating an internal market where trade can flow freely and where there are no duties imposed on internal borders the EU has pronounced itself as a customs union where there is a common external customs tariff for goods (Article 28 TFEU). As a customs union, goods entering the EU from third states (ie non EU states) are subject to the same external tariff, irrespective of where they enter it. Once goods from third states have been subject to the appropriate duties upon crossing the external EU border, they are regarded as being in ‘free circulation’ and are to be treated like any other goods produced within the EU. Thus the EU has exclusive competence to negotiste trade agreements with non-EU states.
As far as the free movement of  persons is concerned it comprises the right  of workers, the self-employed and legal persons (ie companies)  to move to another Member State and access the job market and take up residence there.. The liberalisation of cross-border services is also crucial to the success of the internal market. Additionally, and in order to remove disadvantages associated with exercising free movement rights, there are ‘ancilliary’ rights which range from the right of workers to move their family with them through to the right to receive social advantages under the same terms and conditions as host-state nationals. A raft of secondary legislation was adopted in the late sixties/early seventies explaining and expanding the scope of rights that attach to the free movement of worker provision. Particular attention is given to the impact of the creation of European Citizenship on some of these freedoms
Students need no former knowledge of EU Law before taking this course, but it may require some additional Reading.

The course introduces students to several legal aspects of the EU action on the global stage, as envisaged in EU primary law, and as interpreted by the European Court of Justice.
It thus examines the actors, principles, rules and processes of the EU interactions with third states and international organisations. In particular, it deciphers the ways in which competence (ie the authority to act) is distributed between EU institutions and Member States, and how (far) EU external competence can be exercised. It also looks at the methodology which the European Court of Justice has developed to help the EU secure a coherent external action, despite the multiplicity of actors involved, and the different procedural arrangements at play.
During the course, we will analyse specific policy areas of EU external activity, such as trade, foreign policy and security. We will also discuss how the EU and its Member States have developed specific forms of cooperation with neighbouring countries like Norway, which involve a degree of participation in the development of EU domestic rules. Students should therefore better understand what type of international actor the EU is in substantive and institutional terms.
Finally, the course will examine the effects of international agreements concluded by the EU, such as the Agreement on the European Economic Area, within the EU legal order. For instance, we will examine how Norway’s agreements with the EU may be invoked before Courts in the EU, to secure the effectiveness of the rules and rights set out by these agreements.
Basic knowledge of EU Law is useful, but not necessary, before taking this course.

Course content
This course seeks to present the international legal framework for refugee and asylum issues and assess its evolution. The course will not concentrate on the asylum laws of one country in particular, rather the approach is multinational in order to provide an overview of the commonalities and conflicts within the world system. Students will attain a thorough knowledge of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951), as well as the principal regional conventions.
Main areas of discussion include the basic U.N. criteria for the attainment, denial, and withdrawal of refugee status, the development of the non-refoulement principle, and the standard of treatment of refugees. The political, social, and economic context of prevention, protection, and solution strategies will be explored. Close study of jurisprudence within international, regional, and national courts and UNHCR actions will provide an understanding of how refugee and asylum law is interpreted and implemented. In addition, the course will analyse the drawbacks and benefits of alternative forms of protection, e.g. temporary protection and safe haven.
Progressive issues such as internally displaced persons and ""development/environmental"" refugees will also be presented. Trends towards expansion of the refugee definition will be assessed by studying regional approaches within Africa, Latin America, and Europe.

The course is designed to give the students a deeper insight into the current changes of international and European law in the direction of forming more comprehensive regimes, applying supranational legal forms, applying international courts and thus also of attaining the qualities of constitutional legal systems. The course will also give an introduction to the theories of democracy which are relevant to the new constitutional levels.
",,,"
Course content
The increasing Europeanization and internationalization of law have resulted in increasingly international processes of legislation. This is also occurring on areas which previously have been considered to be primarily of internal interest for the nation states and their legislative institutions. Several and very comprehensive treaties have been made into national legislation or have given supranational organizations the competence to legislate with direct internal effect. Parts of the EC/EU treaties are supranational in character. Several treaties have also established courts or other conflict-resolution mechanisms which have contributed significantly to the increased efficiency of the implementation of international law. The meaning of the concepts of sovereignty and democracy relating to the constitutions of the nation-states are thus distinctly influenced. The same would be true for the status of the democratic legitimacy of law.
Questions are thus raised and discussed about the relations between the nation-states and the various international and European treaties and conflict-resolving mechanisms within a constitutional framework and regarding the demands for a democratic legitimacy of law. It is suggested in international constitutional theory that instead of a dichotomy between national and international law we are now increasingly seeing forms of combination, overlapping and interdependence between several constitutional levels of law.
This course seeks to present and to discuss these questions. Particular emphasis is put on a presentation and discussion of the constitutional character of the EU/EC treaties. The EEA treaty will also be presented. This is partly because these treaties presently are the most comprehensive international treaties seen from the point of view of the nation-states and their regulatory traditions, but also partly because there is a rich legal literature here. There will also be contributions discussing how the evolution of an increasing europeanization and internationalization has influenced the legal concepts of sovereignty, democracy and nation-state, and more comprehensively the concepts and the discourse of constitutions and constitutionality.
The concept of citizenship will be discussed within the new and more international constitutional framework. The evolution of a more international and European orientation of the European nation-states will be put into a historical perspective in one contribution. There will also be articles discussing normative aspects of this evolution and how it should be described legally, institutionally and normatively. The course will thus have its profile within a law-in-context tradition attempting to describe the evolution of new legal processes and structures in the constitutional area in a combined legal, institutional and normative way.

From the course, one gains a firm understanding of the basic rules and principles for protecting privacy and personal information, particularly as laid down in EU and other international instruments. One gains also insight into the myriad regulatory challenges in the field. Further, one learns about the potential for technological development to both threaten and enhance privacy protection.
",,,"
Course content
The course studies legal rules on data protection—i.e., a set of norms which specifically govern the processing of data relating to persons (personal data) in order to protect, at least partly, the privacy and related interests of those persons.
Outside Europe, such norms are often described in terms of protecting “privacy”, “information privacy”, or increasingly, “data privacy”. The main focus of the course is on European and international codes, primarily the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) Article 8, the EU ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC), along with case law pursuant to these instruments. Special attention is also given to the interplay between data protection law and intellectual property rights, particularly in the context of efforts to curb digital “piracy”, regulate digital platforms and increase the transparency of automated decisional processes.
The themes taken up in the course may be summed up with the following key-words: privacy, data protection, surveillance, cyberspace, intellectual property, algorithmic regulation, freedom of expression.

The legal protection of human rights on the international level is a concept that has developed largely since the end of World War II. The United Nations and regional organisations, most notably the Council of Europe, have taken the lead in ensuring respect for human rights through international legal and political mechanisms. This course focuses on the institutions, treaties and practices of these intergovernmental organisations, in addition to international criminal tribunals, providing a perspective of both the normative standards defining international human rights and the means by which they are monitored and implemented.

International Humanitarian Law (IHL) defines methods and means of warfare in armed conflicts and establishes various forms of protection for civilians, other non-combatants as well as combatants. The rules seek to balance military necessity against fundamental principles of humanity. The principles of proportionality, the principle of distinction between military objectives and civilian objects, as well as the principle on unnecessary suffering and superfluous injury form the basis for this body of law.
The legal bases for IHL are rules of international customary law as well as treaty law, in particular the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 with their additional protocols of 1977, and the Hague Regulations of 1907. In addition there are several specific treaties pertaining to e.g. use of certain weapons and other means of warfare.
The subject International Humanitarian Law is a part of public international law, but does not go in detail into the rules on the legality of warfare (jus ad bellum). The main focus is on which rules apply when there is an armed conflict going on (jus in bello), irrespective of the status of the conflict. International Humanitarian Law has certain contact points with two other subjects under public international law; international criminal law and international human rights law.

Financial Markets Law and Regulation matters to us all. It is about our payments, mortgages, banking, other forms of savings and pensions.  It is also about Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the shares and bank-loans to business and the financial system. How should the law protect depositors and investors? How can regulation promote the stability of financial markets to avoid another financial crash? How to balance efficiency and competition with stability and the universal provision of banking services? 
Financial Markets Law and Regulation is increasingly important to the work of lawyers in private practice, in companies and the public sector from ministries down to local authorities, and it is undergoing rapid change involving fundamental policy choices.
The regulation of contracts between banks and their customers in national law is subject to EU directives, regulations and the practice of the European Court of Justice. It is made more complex by the impact of international standard setting, European human rights law and domestic constitutional and public and private law.
This course in financial market law and regulation includes the rules of banks, insurance and other investments, their products and the markets these are offered in with securities regulation. The course covers licensing/authorisation of banks, insurance companies and investments firms and investment funds, the organization of institutions and markets and conduct of business rules with investor protection. 
The main focus are International and European sources and the interplay between national and European rules and supervisory authorities (“Finanstilsynet” and the three European Supervisory Authorities;The European Banking Authority, The European Securities and Markets Authority and The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority).

The course presents the international legal framework for women's human rights with emphasis on basic principles such as equality and non-discrimination, freedom, integrity and dignity embedded in the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).
The principle of substantive equality and direct, indirect, structural and intersectional discrimination is elaborated in the light of the CEDAW with reference to relevant provisions in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, European Union Law and the Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of African Women.
The right to equality and non-discrimination, integrity and freedom is substantiated through a focus on the right to work, reproductive health rights, the right to protection against violence, the right to housing and land and the right to water and sanitation.
National and local case studies from Scandinavia, Asia and Africa demonstrate how state and non-state actors have invoked, adopted or resisted the CEDAW and related instruments in different legal, political, economic and socio-cultural contexts.
Cross-cutting core topics are:

The CEDAW regime’s added value in comparison to and in interaction with other international mechanisms  with focus on the CEDAW’s gender specific, transformative and holistic approach.
How international law responds to women’s lived realities with focus on protection against violence  and social economic rights such as the right to work the right to a home and the right to water.
The relationship between different human rights principles, such as gender equality, freedom of religion and protection of custom and culture.
The domestication of women’s right to gender equality and non-discrimination through civic action, legislation and judicial review.
The relationship between human rights and legal pluralism: NGO’s as mediators and translators between international, national and local norms.

",,,"
Course content
This course provides interdisciplinary insight into the theory and practice concerning the globalisation of law and legal research.
Building on the long tradition of comparative law and method, the course explores how internationalisation requires new perspectives on the role and function of law and legal institutions and a new set of methodological tools. The course seeks to cover key literature and cutting-edge topics concerning the research front on internationalisation of law; while at the same time providing practical input for thesis writing. The course is designed to appeal to research fellows using a range of approaches to study legal phenomenon, whether doctrinal, philosophical, social scientific or humanities-based.
The first part of the course covers comparison. The tradition and debates within comparative law are traversed, especially its purposes and epistemology, with concrete examples from public law, private law and criminology. This is complemented by a focus on comparative method, which may be applicable in domestic law or any research design. The methodological discussion and reading covers research design (e.g., similar systems, hard case approaches), selection of cases, modes of comparison, and practical challenges.
The second part of the course concerns international law and the growing panoply of systems, institutions, courts and tribunals as well as the methods they employ. The course will focus on the cutting-edge issues in the theory and practice of international law as well as European law and role of international law in national law. It is largely assumed that participants have a basic understanding of the key principles of public international law (though some of the readings provide background). This part of the course will examine interdisciplinary approaches to studying international law, for example on the legitimacy and politics of international courts or conducting fieldwork on the role of international law. 
The third part of the course examines transnational law. It partly examines traditional transnational private law (e.g. conflicts of jurisdictions) but focus mostly on the rising role of largely private actors in creating and implementing legal standards. These actors include multinational corporations, world-wide federations (e.g., IOC), non-governmental organisations and adjudicative bodies created by non-state actors. The course examines the legal development, as well as its legal geography, legitimacy and politics and how many legal, criminological and socio-legal questions involve a strong transnational component.
The module is designed with a number of participatory components, which can include literature presentations, PH.D-related discussion, café walk and talk, and structured discussions.

The course will provide:

The ability to historically contextualize the various thematic subfields of contemporary doctrinal law.
A conceptual framework for analyzing and  critically reflecting on law’s societal role and relevance.
An understanding of the relationship between legal and economic models and systems, and concepts for reflecting on legal norms through the prism of economic rationality.
An overview of central theoretical and methodological questions and debates in legal history, sociology of law and law and economics, and to be able to situate these within the broader field of law as an academic discipline.
The ability to reflect on the epistemological challenges as well as challenges related to research methods and strategies raised by these theories and methodological issues.

",,,"
Course content
Increasingly, research on dogmatic legal issues require multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches in addition to the traditional theoretical and methodological toolbox of doctrinal legal scholarship. The aim of the course is to focus on central thematic, theoretical and methodological issues in legal history, sociology of law and law and economics. These disciplines offer exeternal perspectives on law as a normative entity: its historical evolution,  the role and relevance of law in contemporary society; and the linkage to forms of economic rationality.

The first part of the course covers legal history. The starting point is the assumption that theoretical and methodological knowledge about notions of temporality  and chronology represent a fruitful dimension of any academic project.  The participants will obtain a greater understanding of how interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaborations  with legal historians can enhance their own research.

		 



The second part of the course concerns sociology of law. The course introduces participants to the following theoretical concepts and debates in contemporary sociology of law: Law and social change; power and litigation; semi-autonomous fields; Legal consciousness; Legal pluralism  and contemporary debates on the datafication and quantification of law.  The aim is to help the participants reflect critically on rule of law debates as well as to understand the potential and limitations of using law as a tool for social change.  Participants will also gain a critical understanding of the implications of the way contributions to the sociology of law have been based on Western, industrialized democracies, and the implications for current debates in the field of legal sociology. The participants will also obtain a greater understanding of how interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaborations  with legal sociologists can enhance their own research.

		 

The third part of the course examines law and economics. The general idea is to introduce the PhD candidates to behavioral and comparative approaches to law and economics, especially from European perspectives. Throught this they are familiarized to the challenges of US based classical economics and law and economics and how they could be answered, with a special focus on the European context.

Course content
The course covers three distinct, but related components.

A first component covers both formal and practical aspects of writing a PhD. -thesis, and of academic writing more generally. The main topics covered are: how to choose, justify and specify one’s research question; the writing process; the PhD. -thesis as a genre; and publishing strategies.
A second component covers research ethics. The course will present and critically discuss the legal rules relative to research ethics in Norway, the institutionalized system of research ethics in Norway, as well as the norms of research ethics prevalent both in Norway and in the international research community. In particular, the course will cover norms pertaining to plagiarism and good scientific practice as well as norms and legal requirements pertaining to the protection of participants in research and the processing of personal data. The course will further discuss whether there are specific research ethical challenges pertaining to legal research.
The third component covers the dissemination of research. The course will discuss why dissemination of research is an important aspect of academic life and give an overview of the many ways in which dissemination can take place: through blogs, social media, public lectures and debates, op-eds, etc. The course will further include practical workshops where participants can get more experience with different types of dissemination.

In order to profit maximally form the course, we recommend taking the course early in one’s PhD. - period.

Peace and Conflict studies traditionally tend to focus on the causes and dynamics of conflict. This is the only legal course in the world which seeks to explore the normative framework and substantive components of peace under international law. How does the international community create a sustainable Peace? How can peace be emancipatory instead of oppressive in the face of growing authoritarianism, nativism, and populism?  Is only Negative Peace law?  How can Positive Peace be justiciable?
We begin with a review of the philosophical origins of the right to peace, followed by legal analysis of relevant international instruments, including the UN Charter, regional instruments, and human rights law. Special lectures address the substantive components of Peace: The prohibition on the Use of Force, the role of the UN Security Council, UN General Assembly, and ICJ, the evolution of third generation Human Rights, the principle of peaceful coexistence, the obligation to pursue peaceful dispute resolution, the link to Sustainable Development and Energy Solidarity, Gender Equality, Non-Discrimination, Transitional Justice, Constitutional Law, and Protection of Refugees. Particular attention is paid to the role of civil society and non-state actors.  Students will be able to apply their knowledge of the interface between peace and international law in careers based on diplomacy, transitional justice, and peace building.

The course aims at providing an understanding of the legal framework that governs international business transactions. The parties are not completely free to regulate their relationship or to ensure that the transaction is governed by a set of rules fully agreeable to them. This course explains how the legal framework restricts the parties’ freedom to contract in an international context. It gives therefore the tools to properly appreciate how far the drafting of an international contract may go, as well as to evaluate whether a claim based on an international contract is likely to be enforceable according to its terms or not.
Students are expected to take active part in the course, since a part of the course will be dedicated to case studies.

Course content
The course examines the competition rules of the European Union; particularly the competition rules concerning undertakings in Articles 101-106 TFEU.
Competition law is the rules which regulate private firms' market conduct, in order to prevent anti-competitive effects on the markets and thereby to maintain efficient competition. Competition law contains three ""pillars"": prohibition of anti-competitive agreements (the ""cartel prohibition""), prohibition of abuse of market power (the ""abuse prohibition"") and regulation of mergers and take-overs (""Merger Control""). These rules are supplemented both by other Treaty provisions as well as secondary legislation. The rules are of great significance since any firm may be subject to heavy fines and/or liability for damages if infringing them. The maximum fine for infringement may be as high as 10% of a firm's annual turnover.
The European Commission plays an active part in enforcing the competition rules, and a study of Competition Law is therefore also a study of EU Administrative Law. This area of Law also gives the student a good opportunity to study the interrelation between Law and economics, since these legal norms often are based on economic theory.
Students need no former knowledge of EU Law before taking this course, but it may require some additional reading.
Students are expected to take an active part in the course since the emphasis is placed upon seminars and discussion groups rather than formal lectures. Students must also be prepared to give presentations to the rest of the group.

Maritime Law – Contracts - is the study of different contracts used in relation to ships, and the international and national legal framework for these contracts. The contracts relates to different aspects of the operation of a ship; building and repair, purchase, ship management, charter parties and bill of lading, and seafarers employment contracts. By examining different contracts with respect to one area of activity, one discovers connections that one perhaps otherwise would not have seen. Shipping is largely international and several of the contracts are based on international conventions or international standard agreements. Maritime Law – Contracts therefore provides the perfect opportunity for experiencing the international aspects of contract law. Students will also specialize in structure and management of shipping companies. The main part of the course is dedicated to charter parties and bill of lading.

Course content
The course provides an in-depth study of the regulation of the energy sector from an international, European and Norwegian perspective.
Energy law covers the regulation of and access to energy resources, energy markets – both physical and financial - and the regulation of energy use. For the purpose of this course, energy law is understood in the broad sense of the term, and both oil, gas and electricity will be covered. The four stages of production, transport, supply and consumption are included, with a focus on upstream and midstream activities.
The course is structured in four parts. Part I provides an introduction to the general legal concepts and principles applicable to energy activities, such as: sovereignty over natural resources, jurisdiction delimitation, ownership and exploitation models, and resources management mechanisms. Part II reviews the key components of the Norwegian model for the regulation of upstream oil and gas activities, including the licensing system, the Joint Operation Agreement, the coordination of petroleum activities at field level through unitisation and joint development, the regime for upstream gas transportation and third party access. It also covers the environmental regulation of petroleum activities. Part III is dedicated to the regulation of electricity generation (hydropower and other sources, onshore and offshore) and transmission/distribution in Norway as well as connection to the European market. This parts includes a review of the applicable European Union (EU) energy market legislation and its implementation in Norway through the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement. Part IV deals with energy trading, both upstream gas sales and wholesale electricity trading, with a review of relevant EU/EEA competition rules, internal energy market legislation and commercial practices in Norway and on the Nordic power market. Supply and energy consumption aspects are covered to a more limited extend.

Course content
This course is designed to provide students with a broad introduction to some of the key substantive policy areas of the European internal market. An understanding of the EU Internal Market will be developed by studying the evolution from a common market to an internal market and by focussing on two of its key components: the free movement of goods and the free movement of persons.
The free movement of goods is one of the ‘four freedoms’ of the European Union. The creation of an internal (often referred to as the single) market, which is one of the central tasks of the EU, is defined as ‘an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty’ (Article 26 TFEU). In order to achieve this, any obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital, as between Member States must be abolished. In particular relation to goods, this necessarily involves the prohibition, as between Member States, of customs duties and quantitative restrictions on the import and export of goods, and all other measures having equivalent effect. In addition to creating an internal market where trade can flow freely and where there are no duties imposed on internal borders the EU has pronounced itself as a customs union where there is a common external customs tariff for goods (Article 28 TFEU). As a customs union, goods entering the EU from third states (ie non EU states) are subject to the same external tariff, irrespective of where they enter it. Once goods from third states have been subject to the appropriate duties upon crossing the external EU border, they are regarded as being in ‘free circulation’ and are to be treated like any other goods produced within the EU. Thus the EU has exclusive competence to negotiste trade agreements with non-EU states.
As far as the free movement of  persons is concerned it comprises the right  of workers, the self-employed and legal persons (ie companies)  to move to another Member State and access the job market and take up residence there.. The liberalisation of cross-border services is also crucial to the success of the internal market. Additionally, and in order to remove disadvantages associated with exercising free movement rights, there are ‘ancilliary’ rights which range from the right of workers to move their family with them through to the right to receive social advantages under the same terms and conditions as host-state nationals. A raft of secondary legislation was adopted in the late sixties/early seventies explaining and expanding the scope of rights that attach to the free movement of worker provision. Particular attention is given to the impact of the creation of European Citizenship on some of these freedoms
Students need no former knowledge of EU Law before taking this course, but it may require some additional reading.

Course content
The course introduces students to several legal aspects of the EU action on the global stage, as envisaged in EU primary law, and as interpreted by the European Court of Justice.
It thus examines the actors, principles, rules and processes of the EU interactions with third states and international organisations. In particular, it deciphers the ways in which competence (ie the authority to act) is distributed between EU institutions and Member States, and how (far) EU external competence can be exercised. It also looks at the methodology which the European Court of Justice has developed to help the EU secure a coherent external action, despite the multiplicity of actors involved, and the different procedural arrangements at play.
During the course, we will analyse specific policy areas of EU external activity, such as trade, foreign policy and security. We will also discuss how the EU and its Member States have developed specific forms of cooperation with neighbouring countries like Norway, which involve a degree of participation in the development of EU domestic rules. Students should therefore better understand what type of international actor the EU is in substantive and institutional terms.
Finally, the course will examine the effects of international agreements concluded by the EU, such as the Agreement on the European Economic Area, within the EU legal order. For instance, we will examine how Norway’s agreements with the EU may be invoked before Courts in the EU, to secure the effectiveness of the rules and rights set out by these agreements.
Basic knowledge of EU Law is useful, but not necessary, before taking this course.

This course offers a broad introduction to international environmental law. This field of law is developing rapidly and is getting increasingly complex. The course provides the student with a good understanding and updated knowledge of the most important issues of the international law related to environmental protection. In its introductory parts it treats such general issues as the development of international environmental law, sources and general principles of international environmental law, general rights and obligations of states, and common issues of compliance and implementation. Thereafter follows a thorough examination of specific topics as atmospheric pollution and climate change, the law of the sea and protection of the marine environment, protection of species and biological diversity including access to and benefit sharing of genetic resources. The final part cover “cross-cutting” topics, such as the relationship to international trade and environmental protection. Relevant cases will be presented at appropriate times during the course for analysis and discussion.

pursuant to the definition of a refugee contained within the 1951
Convention on the Status of Refugees and regional instruments. The principal aspects of inclusion, exclusion, cessation and non-refoulement criteria will be addressed. Students will be expected to demonstrate critical thinking in evaluating the reasoning and conclusions of national and international judges contained in case law.

Course content
This course seeks to present the international legal framework for refugee and asylum issues and assess its evolution. The course will not concentrate on the asylum laws of one country in particular, rather the approach is multinational in order to provide an overview of the commonalities and conflicts within the world system. Students will attain a thorough knowledge of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951), as well as the principal regional conventions.
Main areas of discussion include the basic U.N. criteria for the attainment, denial, and withdrawal of refugee status, the development of the non-refoulement principle, and the standard of treatment of refugees. The political, social, and economic context of prevention, protection, and solution strategies will be explored. Close study of jurisprudence within international, regional, and national courts and UNHCR actions will provide an understanding of how refugee and asylum law is interpreted and implemented. In addition, the course will analyse the drawbacks and benefits of alternative forms of protection, e.g. temporary protection and safe haven.
Progressive issues such as internally displaced persons and ""development/environmental"" refugees will also be presented. Trends towards expansion of the refugee definition will be assessed by studying regional approaches within Africa, Latin America, and Europe.

The course is designed to give the students a deeper insight into the current changes of international and European law in the direction of forming more comprehensive regimes, applying supranational legal forms, applying international courts and thus also of attaining the qualities of constitutional legal systems. The course will also give an introduction to the theories of democracy which are relevant to the new constitutional levels.
",,,"
Course content
The increasing Europeanization and internationalization of law have resulted in increasingly international processes of legislation. This is also occurring on areas which previously have been considered to be primarily of internal interest for the nation states and their legislative institutions. Several and very comprehensive treaties have been made into national legislation or have given supranational organizations the competence to legislate with direct internal effect. Parts of the EC/EU treaties are supranational in character. Several treaties have also established courts or other conflict-resolution mechanisms which have contributed significantly to the increased efficiency of the implementation of international law. The meaning of the concepts of sovereignty and democracy relating to the constitutions of the nation-states are thus distinctly influenced. The same would be true for the status of the democratic legitimacy of law.
Questions are thus raised and discussed about the relations between the nation-states and the various international and European treaties and conflict-resolving mechanisms within a constitutional framework and regarding the demands for a democratic legitimacy of law. It is suggested in international constitutional theory that instead of a dichotomy between national and international law we are now increasingly seeing forms of combination, overlapping and interdependence between several constitutional levels of law.
This course seeks to present and to discuss these questions. Particular emphasis is put on a presentation and discussion of the constitutional character of the EU/EC treaties. The EEA treaty will also be presented. This is partly because these treaties presently are the most comprehensive international treaties seen from the point of view of the nation-states and their regulatory traditions, but also partly because there is a rich legal literature here. There will also be contributions discussing how the evolution of an increasing europeanization and internationalization has influenced the legal concepts of sovereignty, democracy and nation-state, and more comprehensively the concepts and the discourse of constitutions and constitutionality.
The concept of citizenship will be discussed within the new and more international constitutional framework. The evolution of a more international and European orientation of the European nation-states will be put into a historical perspective in one contribution. There will also be articles discussing normative aspects of this evolution and how it should be described legally, institutionally and normatively. The course will thus have its profile within a law-in-context tradition attempting to describe the evolution of new legal processes and structures in the constitutional area in a combined legal, institutional and normative way.

Course content
International Criminal Law is undergoing a dramatic development these days. This course seeks to present the most current state of this field and its place in the modern international legal system. The course will discuss the development of individual criminal responsibility under international law, including the notion of international crimes. The objective and subjective components of war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity and crime against peace will be discussed. Further, the course will discuss general principles of international criminal law, such as the principle of legality, guilt, modes of participation, defenses, jurisdiction and immunity.
The course will analyze the factual background and legal legal basis of the Nüremberg and Tokyo tribunals and International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as well as selected jurisprudence of these tribunals. An emphasis will be placed on the statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) adopted in Rome 1998 and entered into force 1st July 2002. The role of the Security Council in the field of international criminal law will be discussed. Further, the course will discuss the implementation of international criminal law on the national level and some relevant jurisprudence of national courts.
The course will look at the various principles that may provide for national jurisdiction - such as universal jurisdiction, questions of immunity, and questions of extradition and abduction. The question whether States have an absolute duty under international law to prosecute international crimes will be discussed. Can a society deal with a former regime’s massive violations of human rights by other means than prosecution that is acceptable to the international community, for example a truth commission? The course will seek to discuss current themes such as (for example) the implications of international criminal law regarding military interventions and the relationship between international criminal law and terrorism.

The primary aim of the course is to facilitate a solid understanding of legal policies on privacy and data protection, particularly in the context of distributed computer networks such as the Internet. More specifically, the course seeks to illuminate the rationale and regulatory logic of such policies along with the various technological challenges that they face.
The course seeks also to illuminate legal-regulatory issues related to freedom of expression, the increasing automatisation of decision-making processes, the increasingly cross-national character of organisational transactions, and the interaction of legal norms with the regulatory effects of IT and other non-legal instruments, such as sectoral codes of practice.
From the course, one gains a firm understanding of the basic rules and principles for protecting privacy and personal information, particularly as laid down in EU and other international instruments. One gains also insight into the myriad regulatory challenges in the field. Further, one learns about the potential for technological development to both threaten and enhance privacy protection.
A further aim of the course is not just to impart knowledge of the relevant legal rules as they currently stand but also to encourage critical appraisal of them. This involves analysing and challenging the assumptions upon which the rules are based, and discussion of alternative regulatory possibilities.
",,,"
Course content
The course studies legal rules on data protection—i.e., a set of norms which specifically govern the processing of data relating to persons (personal data) in order to protect, at least partly, the privacy and related interests of those persons.
Outside Europe, such norms are often described in terms of protecting “privacy”, “information privacy”, or increasingly, “data privacy”. The main focus of the course is on European and international codes, primarily the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) Article 8, the EU ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC), along with case law pursuant to these instruments. Special attention is also given to the interplay between data protection law and intellectual property rights, particularly in the context of efforts to curb digital “piracy”, regulate digital platforms and increase the transparency of automated decisional processes.
The themes taken up in the course may be summed up with the following key-words: privacy, data protection, surveillance, cyberspace, intellectual property, algorithmic regulation, freedom of expression.

Course content
This course addresses key regulatory questions regarding cybersecurity and cybercrime. The point of departure of the course is the increasing focus on cybersecurity not only as a technical issue, but also as a regulatory and policy concern. Cybersecurity is now a top priority for governments, businesses and other policy-makers around the world. It is a prime concern for citizens too, as cyber threats also impact on their many everyday digital transactions and interactions. The course primarily studies cybersecurity norms in domestic, European and international law. These rules focus on cybersecurity in a variety of regulatory contexts, including national security, protection of critical infrastructure, data privacy and international warfare. The course takes account of developments of cybersecurity norms in a global perspective (with particular focus on the role of the ITU, OECD, WTO and other IGOs), the emergence of doctrines of cyber-sovereignty (particularly important, for example, in Russia and China), and unfolding regulatory policy on use of cryptography (with focus on legal rules governing the ability of law enforcement agencies to be given access to unencrypted or decrypted data). A second strand of the course focuses on cybercrime (both its substantive and procedural elements), along with digital forensics.
The chief “hard law” instruments to be examined are the EU’s Network and Information Security Directive (2016), security rules in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (2016), and transpositions/equivalents of these instruments in Norwegian law, with a focus on Norway’s Security Act (sikkerhetsloven). In the context of cybercrime, the course mainly examines the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (2001) and the EU Directive on Attacks against Information Systems.

Legal Technology refers to the use of technology, software and computer analytics to provide legal services and justice. It is increasingly transforming legal practice and institutions and the nature of law and research. The most prominent development is the rise of computational applications in artificial intelligence in legal fields diverse as asylum, contracts, policing and finance. Moreover, creative uses of digital platforms and blockchain technology are providing new possibilities in dispute resolution, legal registries and private law orderings.
This course will critically explore current trends and future possibilities of this transformation from the perspectives of legal science, computer science, social science and ethics. Students will:

Learn about long-standing theory in law and artificial intelligence
Study the rise of diverse computational law methods and processes
Explore potential future applications and development
Critically examine the sociology and ethics of this transformation for law and the legal profession.

The primary objective of the course is to impart solid understanding of the steering and management of core elements of Internet infrastructure, particularly data transmission protocols and the Domain Name System. 
A secondary objective is to impart understanding of the respective roles and relative utility of respectively (i) contractual mechanisms and (ii) legislative and treaty-based mechanisms for global governance structures in Internet governance generally, but with a focus particularly on the management and steering of the DNS. This involves elucidating the regulatory function of contracts in Internet governance, and understanding how the various regulatory frameworks impact each other.
A further aim of the course is not just to impart knowledge of the relevant legal rules as they currently stand but also to encourage critical appraisal of them. This involves analysing and challenging the assumptions upon which the rules are based, and discussion of alternative regulatory possibilities.

Course content
The course concentrates on the regulatory field termed “Internet governance”, which may be loosely defined as the various sets of norms (legal and non-legal) that determine how the Internet and its related applications function. In addition to elucidating the legal aspects of Internet governance, the course examines the regulatory role played by Internet architecture itself and how the technical standards for that architecture are developed.
Special consideration is given to governance of the Domain Name System (DNS), as a key component of what are commonly termed “critical Internet resources”. The course elaborates on the processes (legal and non-legal) that regulate allocation of domain names and resolve disputes connected to such allocation. 
Account is also taken of the impact of:

the EU legal framework for network neutrality
the regulation, by the EU, of Internet platforms, particularly with respect to user-generated content
regulatory issues regarding the “Internet of Things”. 

A salient set of issues taken up in the course concern the respective roles played in Internet governance by, on the one hand, contractual (and other private law) mechanisms and, on the other hand, legislative and treaty-based mechanisms.

This course addresses emerging regulatory issues related to robotics. The point of departure of the course is the increasing significance robots have in our society, which not only raises technical issues, but also regulatory and policy concerns.
Recent advances in robotics and artificial intelligence indicate that robots gradually become a reality in society, rather than just in science fiction. Applications include autonomous cars and other vehicles, autonomous weapons, as well as assistants in many fields, including healthcare. Thus, the forms and purposes of robots differ, so it may be impossible to develop one singular regulatory response to the broad field of robotics. On the other hand, there are certain recurring features of robots, which are relevant in a regulatory context.
Lawmakers are currently developing new concepts and definitions, concurrent with the potential drafting of a new legal framework. One of these attempts is the European Parliament’s working definition of a “smart robot”: Its characteristics include (i) the acquisition of autonomy through sensors or data exchange, (ii) potentially self-learning, (iii) at least a minor physical support, (iv) the adaptation of its behaviour and actions to the environment, as well as (v) absence of life in the biological sense.
The role of Artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics warrants specific scrutiny. Whether or not embodied in a physical robot, AI is increasingly deployed in a wide range of contexts. These include predictive policing, chatbots, and corporate decision-making. Amongst the challenges with AI has been the potential for bias in decision-making, which can contribute to discrimination, including for gender or race.
The analysis of regulatory issues takes particular account of ethical and gender perspectives. Ethical concerns arise, for example, when robots such as autonomous weapons or vehicles decide about life or death, and when they calculate risk. Moreover, ethical issues are crucial for all human-robot interaction, such as in the context of healthcare robots.
When humans and robots interact, there can be issues with respect to both human gender and robot gender. The clearest example of the latter is the development of sex robots.
This course examines how robots and artificial intelligence are regulated de lege lata, and tracks the discourse about the need for new law (de lege ferenda). It is far from clear how society should respond to the emergence of these technologies, and students should think creatively about these questions. The course also tracks the development of soft law, such as codes of conduct for robot engineers.
Relevant legal and regulatory issues include the following:

Responsibility, accountability, liability and insurance
Regulatory oversight by the proposed European Agency for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence
Regulatory frameworks for safety, security, and privacy
Robots and networks (network neutrality; cloud computing)
Autonomous weapons systems and public international Law
Human dignity, gender issues and privacy in the context of healthcare robots, cyborgs and augmented humans
Regulatory responses to emerging artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence and copyright protection

Professor Anna Maria C. Lundberg explains why the themes in this course are so important.

The international legal protection of human rights has mainly developed  since the end of World War II. The United Nations and regional organisations, most notably the Council of Europe, have taken the lead in ensuring respect for human rights through international legal and political mechanisms. This course focuses on the institutions, treaties and practices of these intergovernmental organisations, providing perspectives on the evolving normative standards defining international human rights, the actors involved, and the processes and means by which they are monitored and implemented. Students will gain knowledge about (1) institutions and procedures; (2) substantive rights and the obligation of states, and (3) analyze the challenges and achievements of the international human rights regime through country studies.

International Humanitarian Law (IHL) establishes protection for civilians, other non-combatants as well as combatants, and limits methods and means of warfare in armed conflict. The rules seek to balance fundamental principles of humanity against military necessity. The principle of proportionality, the principle of distinction between military objectives and civilian objects, as well as the prohibition against means of combat that lead to unnecessary suffering and superfluous injury, form the basis for this body of law.
The legal bases for IHL are rules of international customary law as well as treaty law, in particular the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 with their additional protocols of 1977, and the Hague Regulations of 1907. In addition there are several specific treaties pertaining to e.g. use of certain weapons and other means of warfare.
International Humanitarian Law is a part of the wider topic Public International Law. It touches upon the rules on the legality of warfare (jus ad bellum), but the main focus is on the rules that apply when an armed conflict is going on (jus in bello), irrespective of the nature of the conflict. International Humanitarian Law has certain contact points with inter alia two other topics under Public International Law; International Criminal Law and International Human Rights law.

The course concerns the relationship between foreign investors and host country governments under international law. The main focus of the course is on the protection of foreign investor rights against exercise of government authority, but the responsibility of foreign investors is also dealt with. 
Protection of foreign investment has for a long time been part of international law. But in recent decades the field has undergone substantial transformation. While foreign investors earlier had to rely on diplomatic protection from their home state, international investment law is to day based on a system of arbitral settlement of disputes between individual investors and host country governments. The field today has a genuine and practical significance both for companies making investments abroad and for host countries where such investments are made, especially developing countries.
The course encompasses the history, development and basic architecture of international investment law, as well as the main rules and standards of its substantive law. The course charts how the law from its fragmented basis in primarily bilateral investment treaties and principles of customary international law, has undergone a dynamic development through international arbitral practice. Currently more than 1000 known arbitral cases have been raised under bilateral and multilateral investment treaties. It has made the field of international investment law into a vibrant legal industry where most international law firms in the great arbitration centres of the world have separate departments specializing in such cases. But it has also created strong controversy and the field is the subject of constant demands for reform and political and academic controversy.
The aim of the course is to develop an understanding of the nature and function of the various legal instruments, mechanisms and processes constituting international investment law, as well as the key issues of the substantive law. The course also aims to provide a critical perspective on the function of the law and its future development.

Financial Markets Law and Regulation matters to us all. It is about our payments, mortgages, banking, other forms of savings and pensions.  It is also about Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the shares and bank-loans to business and the financial system. How should the law protect depositors and investors? How can regulation promote the stability of financial markets to avoid another financial crash? How to balance efficiency and competition with stability and the universal provision of banking services? 
Financial Markets Law and Regulation is increasingly important to the work of lawyers in private practice, in companies and the public sector from ministries down to local authorities, and it is undergoing rapid change involving fundamental policy choices. 
The regulation of contracts between banks and their customers in national law is subject to EU directives, regulations and the practice of the European Court of Justice. It is made more complex by the impact of international standard setting, European human rights law and domestic constitutional and public and private law.
This course in financial market law and regulation includes the rules of banks, insurance and other investments, their products and the markets these are offered in with securities regulation. The course covers licensing/authorisation of banks, insurance companies and investments firms and investment funds, the organization of institutions and markets and conduct of business rules with investor protection. 
The main focus are International and European sources and the interplay between national and European rules and supervisory authorities (“Finanstilsynet” and the three European Supervisory Authorities;The European Banking Authority, The European Securities and Markets Authority and The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority).

Democracy and rule of law are two main pillars in the modern western state model. This state model has its origin in Europe in the middle of the 12th century, when ideas and structures concerning rule of law were developed. Ideas and structures concerning democracy were chiefly developed from the 18th century onwards. The relation between rule of law and democracy has since then been regularly debated, with the Supreme Court’s making of precedent and review of legislation as ever returning themes. The transnationalization of law has caused a shift in focus and of activity from the legislator to the judiciary, and more specific from Parliament to Constitutional and  Supreme Court. By studying the development of European Supreme Court models, their role in politics and rule of law today, the analysis might  –  with acknowledged uncertainty – also be used to predict the future development of the relationship between democracy and rule of law, and the role of Supreme Courts in this development.

The course presents the international legal framework for women's human rights with emphasis on basic principles such as equality and non-discrimination, freedom, integrity and dignity embedded in the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).
The principle of substantive equality and direct, indirect, structural and intersectional discrimination is elaborated in the light of the CEDAW with reference to relevant provisions in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, European Union Law and the Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of African Women.
The right to equality and non-discrimination, integrity and freedom is substantiated through a focus on the right to work, reproductive health rights, the right to protection against violence, the right to housing and land and the right to water and sanitation.
National and local case studies from Scandinavia, Asia and Africa demonstrate how state and non-state actors have invoked, adopted or resisted the CEDAW and related instruments in different legal, political, economic and socio-cultural contexts.
Cross-cutting core topics are:

The CEDAW regime’s added value in comparison to and in interaction with other international mechanisms  with focus on the CEDAW’s gender specific, transformative and holistic approach.
How international law responds to women’s lived realities with focus on protection against violence  and social economic rights such as the right to work the right to a home and the right to water.
The relationship between different human rights principles, such as gender equality, freedom of religion and protection of custom and culture.
The domestication of women’s right to gender equality and non-discrimination through civic action, legislation and judicial review.
The relationship between human rights and legal pluralism: NGO’s as mediators and translators between international, national and local norms.

Through this course, the students will develop their lawyering skills on legal writing and oral advocacy in international law. Taking this course presupposes prior knowledge of international law and its practice. While acknowledging the growing complexity and differences among various fields of international law, the course will address some of the main issues arising in the context of practicing international law before two permanent international courts, namely the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). The course shall also help the students improve their academic legal writing skills.
The main issues covered during the seminars include an introduction to legal research methods in international law, the structure of legal argumentation, the interpretation of different international legal sources, good legal writing, and oral advocacy skills. Students will learn how to find and use various sources of international law, approach international legal questions from an academic or lawyering perspective, and construct sound legal arguments. Necessary attention will be paid also to ensuring proper referencing and avoiding plagiarism.
Writing skills are developed through a couple of non-graded short written exercises, culminating in the writing of a final written submission based on a fictitious case. Oral advocacy skills are developed through lectures and short videos, and focus on presentations and mooting. The improvement of oral advocacy skills shall serve the students in different professional situations, as well as help them prepare for a mock trial presentation before a bench of selected judges.
Every student will be assigned a role as either applicant or respondent. The written submission and oral presentation will be assessed by international law experts. The final assessment for this course is based on both a written submission and a mock trial presentation, based on a fictitious case. The written submission will be of a maximum of 4,000 words, footnotes included.

This course addresses international calls to ‘do justice’ in the aftermath of mass violence and international crimes, and their manifestations in international criminal tribunals, courts and reconciliation processes. The course is based on discussions of course literature, different analytical perspectives and empirical case studies.
We address the rationales behind and outcomes of international criminalization processes and related re-presentations of victims and perpetrators of mass violence. While the course emphasizes the special contribution the criminological and socio-legal perspectives can give to the study of mass violence and international criminal justice., it alsocrosses disciplinary boundaries and emphasizes a variety of approaches to these issues.
With literature suggestions as a point of departure, each lecture will present and discuss the current status of research related to the given theme. Six themes form the primary content and focus of this course:

A historical perspective on international criminal justice
Contemporary politics and perspectives on international criminal justice
Transitional justice approaches: amnesties, truth commissions, reparations
Representations of perpetrators and international punishment
Representations of victims and victims’ justice
Representations of the ‘international community’

",,,"
Course content
Surveillance is an ever-expanding practice, which criminologists need to be equipped to address and assess. The course introduces and discusses different logics of crime control and the management of populations by means of surveillance. It will walk the students through key surveillance theories, moving from classic theories about the visual via recent re-theorizations of surveillance that take account of new information technologies, big tech, big data and algorithms, as well as practices of resistance to surveillance.
Core themes include


the relation between the surveillor and the surveilled,


different forms of surveillance, meaning what media and tools are used for surveillance, in which contexts surveillance takes place, and who participates in surveillance,


which kinds of crime surveillance addresses and how it contributes to the definition of crime,


the effects and the limits of surveillance,


the legal dimension and consequences of surveillance practices.


The theoretical part of each session will be complemented and illustrated by matching cases of surveillance practices and politics. Examples can also include elements from the arts (esp. literature, art, film). The course syllabus contains readings from criminology and critical security studies, including classic readings, but also postmodern accounts of surveillance, philosophy and STS.

",,,"
Course content
Criminologists increasingly take an interest in the ways that destination states seek to control migration, including through criminal law, imprisonment, detention and return. While goods are allowed to circulate comparatively freely in modern capitalism, people are not. Migration control has changed contemporary penal systems.

Aspiring migrants face a variety of obstacles to international mobility. Actual migrants are subjected to border control but also a range of other policies upon entry, sifted into legal-bureaucratic categories that determine the lawfulness of their stay and deportability. Migrants who find themselves unwelcome by the authorities are not without agency, however, and may seek to resist policing and circumvent the legal obligation to return as non-members of society.

This course both explores how Norway and other destination states construct the influx of migrants and respond to it, and how migrants experience and resist being governed. It looks at the legal, ethical and practical limits of state power to control migration, and the myriad state, supra-state and non-state actors that shape the outcomes of migration control. The course is interdisciplinary, approaching migration control from multiple vantage points to unpack some of its complexity in an age of (im)mobility.

Key concepts that will be discussed in this course include

Migration management/control
Policing
Detention
Assisted return and deportation
Migration theory
Border control
Citizenship

This course addresses various forms of environmental crimes and harms as well as various forms of animal abuse, both those which are legal and those which are illegal, through examples of empirical research. Harms are i.e. those produced by, pollution, deforestation and illegal logging, wildlife trafficking and biopiracy. The course critically examines criminalization processes; the mechanisms which cause some of these harms to be legal while others are criminalized. The course further addresses the mechanisms which cause environmental crimes, such as consumerism and capitalism.
Concerns within the field are how crime is conceptualized, law enforcement and punishment, or lack of punishment, in relation to such harms, how they should be understood and how they should be addressed.
The course crosses disciplinary boundaries and emphasizes a variety of approaches to these issues, although with a criminological starting point. These approaches include perspectives which, for example, are lent from philosophy, such as moral rights and perspectives of justice.

What happens when democratic principles and the rule of law is challenged and legal systems begin to produce injustice and human rights violations on a grand scale? How do judges and bureaucrats react in such situations – do they oppose or support totalitarian regimes and authoritarian ideologies? How robust is the law and traditional legal authority when thoroughly challenged? Is the international human rights system an effective solution to such problems?
These are some of the important questions addressed in this course. We examine these issues by looking at the legal system and its agents in totalitarian regimes and in democracies in situations of crisis where the rule of law and human rights comes under attack. The historical examples will include the Third Reich, where we analyze the role of judges and the relationship between Nazi ideology and the law. We also seek to understand to what degree a modern and legal bureaucracy helped produce the Holocaust. Following that the Nurnberg Court and its legacy is discussed and the rise of an international and regional human rights regime is described. Further historical examples include the role of law and judges in Communist Dictatorships and the Apartheid-system. We will also focus on contemporary examples of what happens when basic human rights standards are challenged in democratic societies, which will include a discussion of the post 9/11 legalization of torture in the US. Theories on the relationship between fear, risk and law will also be discussed. Finally, the apparent crisis of the international human rights regime is analyzed and the current and future role of human rights will be discussed.

The course is aimed at bachelor students interested in the cross-cultural aspects of changing laws and legal institutions in the context of an increasingly transnational legal, economic, technological and social world: How are laws and legal institutions made, used, reshaped? How do legal norms, actors and institutions affect the everyday life and the cultural fabric of society? How and with what effect are actors embedded in transnational personal, religious or economic relations and how do they negotiate space between the plurality of norms and institutions that affect their affairs? The course primarily aims to attract students of law and social science but will also be of interest to students from theology and the humanities.
The course introduces students to central analytical concepts in legal anthropology. Legal pluralism facilitates the study of the norm-generating and norm-upholding process that are taking place within and across different socio-legal fields, at international, national and local levels in different time periods. Law as a semi-autonomous social field situates state-law in the context of the wide range of norms that are invoked by different professional and social actors. The concepts of indigenization and vernacularization are used to make sense of how international law interacts with national and local norms. Finally, the students are introduced to anthropological approaches to legality and illegality.
The course lectures will address the following themes:

The history of legal anthropology
Anthropology and international law
The anthropology of the state and citizenship
Ethnographic perspectives on justice:
		
Institutional perspectives on bureaucracies, courts and legal professions.
				Bottom-up” actor perspectives on rights claiming and legal mobilization



Law in the everyday life: the anthropology of the private sphere.


The anthropology of the Market.

Students should have knowledge in math corresponding to ECON2200 – Matematikk 1/Mikro 1 (MM1) (discontinued). There will be organized an elective week course in math at the start of the semester.
",,"
Learning outcome
This course is about the application of economics to problems related to demand for health, demand for health insurance and provision of health insurance. The point of departure is that the demand for health care is derived from the demand for health. The demand for health contains a tradeoff between prevention and cure. Also the effects of early childhood influences of later life health outcomes will be covered. Uncertainty related to future health creates demand for health insurance. Health insurance implies that the price the consumer faces when using health services is lowered. Typically, the consumer has more information about the probability of illness and preventive effort than the insurer. Hence, the decline in consumer price may encourage a decline in prevention and an increase in the demand for health services. Social efficiency requires that the benefit from insurance be balanced against the inefficiency caused by moral hazard and adverse selection. The analysis of alternative designs of health insurance is an important part of the course.
Knowledge
This course will provide knowledge about:

The modeling of demand for health and health services within an economic framework
The factors that impact on the trade-off between prevention and cure
The effects of early childhood influences of later life health outcomes
The factors that impact on the demand for health insurance. Central components are the uncertainty about future health states and the consumer’s attitude towards risk
The construction of optimal health insurance schemes. Important keywords are asymmetric information, adverse selection, ex ante and ex post moral hazard and patient co-payment
The advantages and disadvantages of different types of insurance schemes

Skills

",,,"
Course content
The use of formula funding of public service expenditures has become widespread as a risk adjustment tool in most developed countries in recent years. Expenditures are typically distributed from a central state or a insurance company to primary care, secondary care or integrated care organizations by such formulas. The formulas are usually composed of demographic and socioeconomic factors. 
The aim of this course is to give the students a basic understanding of how demand or need analyses can be used to construct the formulas and to discuss the relevance of these methodologies for public policy and planning.
The course offers both an introduction to the theory and practice underlying the use of formulas as a basis for funding public services. The starting point is regression analyses of the use of health care services (or other services where formulas are used such as social security and education). From these analyses we identify variables that correlate with the variation in use of services across geographical areas, typically demographic and sociodemographic variables. The last step is to calculate a formula based on these variables that can be used for distributive purposes.

Course content
The course will focus on the use of epidemiologic methods relevant for register-based data. Official health registers in Norway, and other registers important for health research will be presented. The characteristics of the different registers will be highlighted by using examples. The course will give an overview of Norwegian laws and regulations pertaining to register-based data. It is of key importance to know the origin of your register data, as the primary purpose of most register data is not research and this has implications for both the type and the quality of the data. Both data quality assessment and data management are important parts of the course. The course will also teach you how to work with large data sets, to combine and analyze them and how to search for errors.

How should the risk of unhealthy habits be communicated to the public? Should we make a decision right now or would it be better to wait and collect more information? Are we subject to psychological mechanisms that create systematically wrong decisions? Would we be better off trying to follow some simple decision rules instead of trying to calculate and select the alternative perceived to be the best? The course provides a general introduction to decision-making with special focus on problems related to health.

By identifying the global system for regulation of health law and policies, the course also intends to explain the ratio of regulatory intervention in national public health systems. The course addresses issues such as access to medicines, people’s rights to health care, market competition in health care, regulation of health professionals’ qualifications, and regulation of pharmaceuticals. These issues are all influenced by legal standards as defined by international law. At the end of the course students should have an overview of the system for global (and EU) health governance, central international health rules and institutions (WTO, WHO, EU), and an understanding of the interface between international law/EU law and national health law and policies.

University of Oslo,UIO,Medicine,Fundamentals of management,5,,,[],,"
Learning outcome
To manage is to act toward a whole organization, or a whole part of an organization. Since this is done both “holistically” and in many specialized ways, those who take this course will both learn the basis of “holistic” (or general) management and the various specialized forms of management. But since this is an introductory course, the “holistic” side of leading and managing – including the choice of management style (or role) – will be given priority. Some concepts of special importance to healthcare managment will be discussed, but in general, students will learn more concretely how to use the various forms of managing in more technically specialized courses.
Thus the main purpose of the course is more scholarly than technical.
This also means that the course should make students become more aware of the relevance and attractiveness of a managerial career for themselves: The course has existential sides to it.

Organizing is one way of managing the provision of health care. Organizations are, however, not only consciously designed, they are also evolving in non-planned ways, or as a function of the competition or clashes between groups with different plans. In this course we will explore the potential, and limitations of managing through designing and redesigning organizations. We will further explore the potential and limitations of different ways of organizing the provision of health care. In this connection we will look particularly at two different ways of looking at organization design activities – looking at it as a craft (as an artistic task) and as a “science” (as a technical task). Hence, it is our aim in this course to make participants  become both expert organization technicians and wise organization developers – at the same time.

The course will include lectures followed by close reading and discussions in smaller groups of original high quality papers in various areas of biology and medicine. At the end of the course, the participants shall have become acquainted with some essential ideas in mathematics and biology, and they shall have trained in communicating in languages and disciplines other than their own.
",,,"
Course content
This course is intended to train the students in interacting with researchers across speciality boarders. In particular, the focus is on the use of mathematics to solve various biological problems. The course is based on critical reading of four selected papers, presentation of key issues related to these papers, followed by discussions in smaller group on the content of the papers.
Systems biology is an emerging field, which heavily depends upon collaboration between biologists and mathematicians. The genome has offered biologists new possibilities to study genetic processes on a genomic scale, and to achieve not only understanding of the function of individual molecules but also to achieve quantitative understanding of the regulation and interaction of genes and molecules at the systems level. This development requires researchers with combined biological, mathematical and computational skills. However, few research students have such combined skills as yet.

",,,"
Course content
The course focuses on prediction of future and/or unmeasured outcomes based on a variety of high-dimensional molecular data. What do we want to
predict? This is typically the success or not of a therapy given to a patient (binary or categorical outcome, also called classification); it can be the bone mineral density or the expression in so called eQTL studies (continuous outcomes); it can be survival after cancer surgery or time to recurrence of a disease (time to event outcomes). In this course we are not studying methods to subdivide the patients in a study in subgroups, as is the aim in sub-typing a disease (unsupervised clustering).
Prediction is based on various models which exploit molecular data as input data (genomics, metabolomics, proteomic, epigenetic data, for example) in addition to other individual variables (demographic, clinical, exposure data). What characterizes these data is their huge dimension (say all genes or all SNPs, so a large number p of variables), compared to a smaller number (n) of individuals in a study. Variables can be discrete, categorical, continuous and also related to more complex structures like ontologies and pathways (networks).
There are many methods which can be used to predict outcomes from data, in a p>n setting. In this course we will focus on A. Penalized methods, like lasso, ridge and elastic net, including parameter tuning using cross- validation, B. Bayesian methods, based on prior knowledge and exploiting Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, C. Machine learning approaches, including tree-based methods, support vector machines, kernel methods and neural networks/ deep learning. We will study ways of combining different predictions with
D. Boosting, bagging and other ensemble methods. Finally we will discuss how to compare and evaluate various prediction methods to determine which one performs best: E. Performance measures of prediction methods and their estimation using resampling methods (bootstrapping, cross-validation). Additional themes which will be treated in the course, and will appear across the five topics above, include (i) selection of variables (ii) interaction (iii) integration of various data sets at different scale, (iv) resampling methods.
The plan of the five days is as follows:
Day 1: Introduction to prediction (versus clustering, estimation and testing). Introduction to the p>n setting. A series of examples of papers based on prediction. Introduction to software: R, Bioconductor, Stan, JAGS and other libraries in R.
Day 2: Penalized approaches (A). Software: glmnet package.
Day 3: Bayesian predictions (B). Software: Stan.
Day 4: Machine learning methods (C). Software: various R/Bioconductor
Day 5: Ensemble methods and performance evaluation (scoring).

be able to understand and critically assess analyses of survival and time-to-event data as they are typically reported in publications.
",,,"
Course content
The analysis of survival data and other types of time-to-event data are central in modern medical research and a number of other fields. A large number of methods for analysing time-to-event data have been developed, but many researchers have no knowledge of survival analysis, or they only know the most basic methods. The aim of the course is to give PhD-students and other researchers in biostatistics, bioinformatics, epidemiology, and related fields an up-to-date overview of statistical methodology for analysing time-to-event data.
The course starts with a broad introduction of the basic concepts and methods in survival and event history analysis, including methods for handling multiple states/outcome such as competing risks. Further topics of special relevance when analysing biobank data and data with high-dimensional covariates are discussed, and alternatives to Cox regression that are particularly useful for non-proportional hazards and time-dependent effects are considered. The effect of unobserved heterogeneity (frailty) in survival analysis is discussed, and methods for analysing recurrent events and clustered data are presented. The course concludes with a discussion of causality and methods for causal inference for survival data.
The course is given over five days and computer exercises will be an integrated part of the course. The course is given in-person only. The plan of the five days is as follows:
Day1: Introduction to survival analysis; statistical methods for one and more samples (Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators, log-rank type tests).
Day 2: Cox regression; competing risks and multistate models.
Day 3: Cox regression for data with high-dimensional covariates (lasso, ridge, elastic net).
Day 4: Cox regression for nested case-control and case-cohort data; Unobserved heterogeneity (frailty) in survival analysis; frailty models for recurrent and clustered data.
Day 5: Additive hazards regression; Poisson regression; causality and causal inference for survival data.

",,,"
Course content
Understanding how the brain works is one of the grand challenges in science and requires the integration of huge amounts of heterogeneous and complex data. Numerous research publications present experimental data at various levels of granularity and describe a wide range of structural and functional aspects of the brain. The management of this deluge of data represents a bottleneck for progress, with a main challenge being that the multiple data categories are difficult to compare. In this context, reference atlases of the brain are important tools for assigning anatomical location and (semi-)automatically analyzing data captured with the many methods and instruments used to study the brain. Reference atlases for the brain rank among the most frequently used and highest cited publications in neuroscience. But integration of data through the use of conventional reference atlases has been difficult to achieve.
With a new generation of three-dimensional digital reference atlases, new solutions for integrating and disseminating brain data are being developed. In many ways, future digital reference atlases and the data systems that will be built around them will be similar to current geographical atlases, such as Google Maps and Google Earth, which provide interactive access to huge amounts of high resolution image data, together with additional information (annotations, practical information, photographs) and more detailed visualizations (e.g. ""street view"") for specific areas. Digital brain atlases play an important role in several large international projects, including the European Union ICT Future Emerging Technologies Flagship project, the Human Brain Project.This course contains an introduction to currently available reference atlases for mouse and rat brain. It will demonstrate how the 3D brain templates for the reference atlases are acquired, how they are used as a basis for delineating the structures of the brain, how they can be enriched by other data modalities, and how they can be used as a basis for assigning location (coordinate based or semantic) to a wide range of structural and functional data collected from the brain. The course will also outline examples of data system employed to organize neuroscience data collections in the context of reference atlases as well as analytical workflows applied to the data, with opportunities for hands-on exploration of selected tools.

Reproductive rights may not be, as it implies abortion rights, which for some is very complicated. Sexual health is probably easy as long as it only applies to sexually transmitted diseases, but sexual rights, again, may incorporate sexual behaviours that in some cultures are seen as very deviant. The course explores why reproductive and sexual health rights are so complicated to implement, and addresses the legal, religious and cultural aspects of the controversies as well as the very serious health consequences of these restrictions, like maternal mortality, high STD prevalence, vulnerability to HIV, knowledge of risks, and cultural practices like FGM and early childbearing. A gender perspective is the overriding principle for the analysis.

• Social determinants of health and illness, inequities in health, gender and social dimensions.
• Human rights framework, and health rights, to reproductive and sexual health and rights.
• Health Policy, policy analysis, informing policy, policy, implementation and strategy.
• Health systems. Macro context, financing, delivery of care, service planning, a tool for change, evaluation of quality of care.
Case studies
• Abortion rights and sex selection
• Violence against women and reproductive health rights
• Access to care and maternal survival
• HIV, sexuality and stigma
• Unmet needs – contraceptives and other needs

Course content
Medical research has become interdisciplinary.  Cross-disciplinary cooperation and integration of multiple research fields has allowed the development of new knowledge and enabled new applications. This development is often called convergence. In this course, we will exemplify convergence by showing how a multifaceted problem can be addressed from different angles. We have chosen morbid obesity as our case; this thematic area will be employed in order to give participants concrete examples of general principals and approaches. It should, however be noted that the course is not a formalized introduction to obesity research – the case merely exemplifies modern research trends.
Multiple, integrated methods and tools can be applied to elucidate this thematic area including randomized controlled trials , R&D initiatives in primary health care, municipal initiatives , programs for increased physical activity and cooperation with NGOs are examples. In the social context, prevention requires increased awareness in schools and in the public, as well as enhanced knowledge of nutrition, public health initiatives, product innovation, dissemination of healthcare products and political decision making.
This course provides an introduction to a variety of scientific perspectives and skills that are required to address such a complex issue. The course includes research within ethics and philosophy of science, epidemiology and statistics. In addition, genetic studies, basic research studies, cell physiology and pathophysiology, and studies of laboratory animals are introduced. The students will work in groups to elucidate the issue from their own point of view.

Course content
The course considers methods integral to data analysis in modern molecular medical research. It is planned that this course will be part 1 of a series of two courses on this topic. As such it is relevant to all PhD students and researchers who need to analyze large-scale molecular data themselves, as well as those who need to interpret results and understand publications in the molecular life sciences.
High-throughput techniques are becoming increasingly more prevalent in research in life sciences and the clinic. However, to make effective use of the resulting large datasets it is necessary to understand and apply more advanced statistical methods. We will introduce the statistical concepts behind typical data analysis tasks for large-scale biological data, including the following topics:
a) high-throughput screening (multiple testing and group tests),
b) unsupervised learning and data visualization (clustering and heatmaps, dimension reduction methods),
c) supervised learning (classification and prediction, cross-validation and bootstrapping).
We will also introduce reference sources and biological databases that can aid interpretation and will show how they can be accessed and integrated into a data analysis.
Methods will be demonstrated by replicating analyses from publications and real-life gene expression data will be used in the computer labs.
To encourage continued learning after the course, we will also provide an overview of available web-based courses and exercises.

Course content
Most researchers in the medical and health sciences focus on health and disease, either directly or indirectly. But what do these basic concepts mean and what do they entail?  Arguing that there is hardly a single answer to these questions, this course explores a variety of theories and perspectives on health, disease, sickness, and suffering. Specifically, the course will critically examine the various ways in which human health and disease is understood and engaged with in medicine and health sciences. By applying perspectives from philosophy, history, sociology, and anthropology the course aims to make you able to view medical and health research in a broader perspective, to see your research questions in new light, and to add to your abilities to interpret and understand data.
The course will investigate concepts, theories, and models of health and disease. In particular it will scrutinize various perspectives, knowledge systems, classification systems, and metaphors. The course will also investigate health management and governance, and analyze the relationship between power, interests, and gender in health and disease.
The course will use a combination of lectures, group work, video, and reflection notes in order to engage the participants in active reflection over basic concepts in health related research. It will actively use participants own research projects as examples.

",,,"
Course content
In depth understanding of molecular methods used for addressing genetic and epigenetic phenomena in basic research and in the clinic.
The understanding of the bases for genetic and epigenetic inheritance has been improved tremendously over the last decades. While Gregor Mendels results completely revolutionized the basic understanding of genetic inheritance with his discoveries in garden pees more than 150 years ago, the understanding of inheritance has recently been challenged by the many dynamic chemical modifications on histones, DNA and RNA that regulate gene expression. Such modifications are able to switch on and off genes without changing the coding sequence of DNA. The very fast switches of individual or group of genes being expressed following fertilization and during development can now be studied in model organisms. What is more, these rapid switches in gene regulation that is required for cellular homeostasis and normal development can also be incorrectly regulated and lead to dysregulation of the cell cycle and cancer.
This course provides an introduction to the various phenomena of genetic and epigenetic inheritance, an updated presentation of novel aspect of epigenetic regulation and examples of epigenetic analysis, including diagnostics and chemotherapeutic agents that have entered the clinic.
Studying genetic and epigenetic regulation in the laboratory is challenging and requires state-of-the-art methodological insight. There will be a particular focus on novel molecular methods used to address these phenomena that includes; analysis of modified bases in DNA and RNA and histone modifications, base-specific DNA sequencing, ChIP and other sequencing methods, CRISPR technology, mutant organisms and clinical samples.

",,,"
Course content
The course focuses on prediction of future and/or unmeasured outcomes based on a variety of high-dimensional molecular data. What do we want to
predict? This is typically the success or not of a therapy given to a patient (binary or categorical outcome, also called classification); it can be the bone mineral density or the expression in so called eQTL studies (continuous outcomes); it can be survival after cancer surgery or time to recurrence of a disease (time to event outcomes). In this course we are not studying methods to subdivide the patients in a study in subgroups, as is the aim in sub-typing a disease (unsupervised clustering).
Prediction is based on various models which exploit molecular data as input data (genomics, metabolomics, proteomic, epigenetic data, for example) in addition to other individual variables (demographic, clinical, exposure data). What characterizes these data is their huge dimension (say all genes or all SNPs, so a large number p of variables), compared to a smaller number (n) of individuals in a study. Variables can be discrete, categorical, continuous and also related to more complex structures like ontologies and pathways (networks).
There are many methods which can be used to predict outcomes from data, in a p>n setting. In this course we will focus on A. Penalized methods, like lasso, ridge and elastic net, including parameter tuning using cross- validation, B. Bayesian methods, based on prior knowledge and exploiting Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, C. Machine learning approaches, including tree-based methods, support vector machines, kernel methods and neural networks/ deep learning. We will study ways of combining different predictions with
D. Boosting, bagging and other ensemble methods. Finally we will discuss how to compare and evaluate various prediction methods to determine which one performs best: E. Performance measures of prediction methods and their estimation using resampling methods (bootstrapping, cross-validation). Additional themes which will be treated in the course, and will appear across the five topics above, include (i) selection of variables (ii) interaction (iii) integration of various data sets at different scale, (iv) resampling methods.
The plan of the five days is as follows:
Day 1: Introduction to prediction (versus clustering, estimation and testing). Introduction to the p>n setting. A series of examples of papers based on prediction. Introduction to software: R, Bioconductor, Stan, JAGS and other libraries in R.

Day 3: Bayesian predictions (B). Software: Stan.
Day 4: Machine learning methods (C). Software: various R/Bioconductor

Course content
The analysis of survival data and other types of time-to-event data are central in modern medical research and a number of other fields. A large number of methods for analysing time-to-event data have been developed, but many researchers have no knowledge of survival analysis, or they only know the most basic methods. The aim of the course is to give PhD-students and other researchers in biostatistics, bioinformatics, epidemiology, and related fields an up-to-date overview of statistical methodology for analysing time-to-event data.
The course starts with a broad introduction of the basic concepts and methods in survival and event history analysis, including methods for handling multiple states/outcome such as competing risks. Further topics of special relevance when analysing biobank data and data with high-dimensional covariates are discussed, and alternatives to Cox regression that are particularly useful for non-proportional hazards and time-dependent effects are considered. The effect of unobserved heterogeneity (frailty) in survival analysis is discussed, and methods for analysing recurrent events and clustered data are presented. The course concludes with a discussion of causality and methods for causal inference for survival data.
The course is given over five days and computer exercises will be an integrated part of the course. The plan of the five days is as follows:
Day1: Introduction to survival analysis; statistical methods for one and more samples (Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators, log-rank type tests).
Day 2: Cox regression; competing risks and multistate models.
Day 3: Cox regression for nested case-control and case-cohort data; Cox regression for data with high-dimensional covariates (lasso, ridge, elastic net).
Day 4: Additive hazards regression; unobserved heterogeneity (frailty); frailty models for recurrent and clustered data.
Day 5: Mixed effects models for discrete time survival data; causality and causal inference for survival data.

Course content
Understanding how the brain works is one of the grand challenges in science and requires the integration of huge amounts of heterogeneous and complex data. Numerous research publications present experimental data at various levels of granularity and describe a wide range of structural and functional aspects of the brain. The management of this deluge of data represents a bottleneck for progress, with a main challenge being that the multiple data categories are difficult to compare. In this context, reference atlases of the brain are important tools for assigning location to data captured with the many methods and instruments used to study the brain. Reference atlases for the brain rank among the most frequently used and highest cited publications in neuroscience. But integration of data through the use of conventional reference atlases has been difficult to achieve.
With a new generation of three-dimensional digital reference atlases, new solutions for integrating and disseminating brain data are being developed. In many ways, future digital reference atlases and the data systems that will be built around them will be similar to current geographical atlases, such as Google Maps and Google Earth, which provide interactive access to huge amounts of high resolution image data, together with additional information (annotations, practical information, photographs) and more detailed visualizations (e.g. ""street view"") for specific areas. Digital brain atlases play an important role in several large international projects, including the European Union ICT Future Emerging Technologies Flagship project, the Human Brain Project.
This course contains an introduction to currently available reference atlases for mouse, rat, and human brain. It will demonstrate how the 3D brain templates for the reference atlases are acquired1 how they are used as a basis for delineating the structures of the brain, how they can be enriched by other data modalities, and how they can be used as a basis for assigning location (coordinate based or semantic) to a wide range of structural and functional data collected from the brain. The course will also outline examples of data system employed to organize neuroscience data collections in the context of reference atlases as well as analytical workflows applied to the data.

The course will give you knowledge about methods for analysis of clustered data. More specifically, you will learn about

Analysis of summary measures (Area under the curve etc.)
Models for repeated measures in longitudinal design
Marginal models (including GEE)
Mixed models / multilevel models.

Skills
The course will give you the skills to:
Analyze correlated data by use of the Stata software. The course will mainly focus on longitudinal data, but other types of correlated data will also be discussed; among these the traditional multilevel designs. The course will concentrate on measurements on continuous scale and linear models, and on data of binary type and logistic models. We will focus on an intuitive understanding of the underlying statistical models rather than the mathematical details, with the goal of understanding the assumptions behind the analysis and the interpretation of the results.         
General competence
The course will make you able to understand the general ideas behind the analysis of correlated data, and to critically evaluate studies based on data of such type.
",,,"
Course content
A major assumption behind all traditional regression models is that of independent observations. However, this assumption may not hold in all situations. Often we will have some sort of clustered data where the independence assumption will not be fulfilled. Examples may be repeated measurements made on the same individual over time, multicenter studies where patients are nested within centres, genetic studies where we have information about family structures, or educational studies with pupils nested within classes, which are again nested in schools. Special sampling procedures, like cluster sampling, may also give rise to this type of data. Common to all these situations is that we will need some regression method that can handle the dependencies between observations. Mixed models are one means to this end. In many instances the terms multilevel models, hierarchical models, and random coefficient models also refer to mixed models, adapted to a given setting.
In this course we will give an introduction to the concept of mixed models. We will focus on the so-called linear mixed model with continuous, normally distributed outcomes. Further, we will introduce generalized linear mixed models, which apply to situations where the outcome variable is not necessarily continuous, such as logistic models for binary outcomes and log-linear models for counts. We will also introduce Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) as an alternative in certain situations.
The focus of the course will be on longitudinal studies, but we will also give examples from other types of studies where such methods are needed.

",,,"
Course content
Causal inference is the task of drawing conclusions from data about the effects of treatments and other type of interventions. In epidemiology and clinical research, as well as in many other fields, formal methods for causal inference play an increasingly central role. This course gives an introduction to basic concepts and ideas in this area.
Among the topics being covered are:

randomization and target trials,
counterfactuals and estimands,
causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),
methods for confounding adjustment,
marginal structural models and time-dependent confounding,
causal mediation analysis,
causal inference in survival analysis.

The area of causal inference has over the last decades grown to be a very active area within statistics. Various new methods have been and are being developed, based on the seminal work by Donald Rubin, James Robins, Judea Pearl and others. This has led to new understandings of how statistical analysis is an integral part of causal inference and a continuously growing toolbox of methods for addressing causal questions.
In epidemiology and clinical research much knowledge about causal effects comes from statistical studies. The new tools give a more precise way of approaching these issues and can help researchers avoid common pitfalls. This course aim to make the participants acquainted with these methodological developments, both for the purpose of performing own research and for assessing the evidence from studies of treatment effects.

The course has five main subjects:Causal graphs (DAGs), Modern Designs, Multiple Imputation, splines in regressions and Multilevel models. Also included are three minor subjects: Interaction, register epidemiology and an introduction to Stata.
Causal graphs introduce Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and will show examples of their use in medical research. DAGs are useful tools for understanding confounding, mediation and selection bias. A DAG analysis shows variables that should be adjusted for, and variables that should not be adjusted for.
The Design part will review classic research designs; cross sectional, cohort and case control. Focus will be on more advanced designs such as nested case control, case cohort and cross over designs. Strengths and weaknesses of the different designs will be discussed and examples of the different designs presented.
Multiple imputation: The lecture gives a short introduction to different missing-data mechanisms and how to handle missing data. The focus will be on multiple imputation, describing the concept of the method, how to choose a suitable imputation model, statistical inference, and challenges. Relevant Stata commands will be given and demonstrated through some examples.
Continuous variables and Splines: Categorizing continuous variables in a regression leads to loss of power. Instead, non-linear effects can be handled by using splines. We will provide Stata commands and examples of use.
Multilevel models gives an introduction to studies that lead to hierarchical data, what problem this gives in the analysis, and how to solve them. Focus is more on the interpretation of results than on the technical aspects of multi-level analysis.
The three last sessions will include workshops using Stata. Please bring your own laptops. Students associated with UiO will get access to Stata (via kiosk). We can work 2-3 persons per computer.

Course content
This is the first of two compulsory courses for all PhD candidates at the Faculty of Medicine. The aim of the course is to provde an introduction to theory of science and research ethics, and basic knowledge about the breadth of research methods that are used in medical and health research. Since the course brings together PhD candidates with many different backgrounds and research projects, it also offers a rare opportunity to get to know colleagues from the entire range of research environments at the Faculty of Medicine. The course exam affords course participants experience with peer reviewing. After the course exam paper has been submitted, it will be assessed by one of the other course participants. Based on the peer comments received, a final version will then be prepared and submitted.
The course’s starting point is that medical research has become decidedly interdisciplinary. Cross-disciplinary cooperation and integration of multiple research fields have allowed the development of new knowledge and enabled new applications. This development is often called convergence. In this course, we will exemplify convergence by showing how a multifaceted problem can be addressed from different angles. We have chosen morbid obesity as our case; this thematic area will be employed in order to give participants concrete examples of general principals and approaches. It should, however be noted that the course is not a formalized introduction to obesity research – the case merely exemplifies modern research trends.
Multiple, integrated methods and tools can be applied to elucidate this thematic area including randomized controlled trials, R&D initiatives in primary health care, municipal initiatives, programs for increased physical activity and cooperation with NGOs. In the social context, prevention requires increased awareness in schools and in the public, as well as enhanced knowledge of nutrition, public health initiatives, product innovation, dissemination of healthcare products and political decision making.
This course provides an introduction to a variety of scientific perspectives and skills that are required to address such a complex issue. The course includes research within ethics and philosophy of science, epidemiology and statistics. In addition, genetic studies, basic research studies, cell physiology and pathophysiology, and studies of laboratory animals are introduced. The students will work in groups to elucidate the issue from their own point of view.
The first course day includes the startup seminar where candidate and supervisors meet. Participation the first day is mandatory

We will introduce the statistical concepts behind typical data analysis tasks for large-scale biological data, including the following topics:
a) high-throughput screening (multiple testing and group tests),
b) unsupervised learning and data visualization (clustering and heatmaps, dimension reduction methods),
c) supervised learning (classification and prediction, cross-validation and bootstrapping).
We will also introduce reference sources and biological databases that can aid interpretation and will show how they can be accessed and integrated into a data analysis.
Methods will be demonstrated by replicating analyses from publications and real-life gene expression data will be used in the computer labs.
To encourage continued learning after the course, we will also provide an overview of available web-based courses and exercises.

",,,"
Course content
In depth understanding of molecular methods used for addressing genetic and epigenetic phenomena in basic research and in the clinic.
The understanding of the bases for genetic and epigenetic inheritance has been improved tremendously over the last decades. While Gregor Mendels results completely revolutionized the basic understanding of genetic inheritance with his discoveries in garden pees more than 150 years ago, the understanding of inheritance has recently been challenged by the many dynamic chemical modifications on histones, DNA and RNA that regulate gene expression. Such modifications are able to switch on and off genes without changing the coding sequence of DNA. The very fast switches of individual or group of genes being expressed following fertilization and during development can now be studied in model organisms. What is more, these rapid switches in gene regulation that is required for cellular homeostasis and normal development can also be incorrectly regulated and lead to dysregulation of the cell cycle and cancer.
This course provides an introduction to the various phenomena of genetic and epigenetic inheritance, an updated presentation of novel aspect of epigenetic regulation and examples of epigenetic analysis, including diagnostics and chemotherapeutic agents that have entered the clinic.
Studying genetic and epigenetic regulation in the laboratory is challenging and requires state-of-the-art methodological insight. There will be a particular focus on novel molecular methods used to address these phenomena that includes; analysis of modified bases in DNA and RNA and histone modifications, base-specific DNA sequencing, ChIP and other sequencing methods, CRISPR technology, mutant organisms and clinical samples.

Course content
Anyone that plan, design and/or conduct animal experiments is required to complete a course in experimental animal science and conduct their activities according to Norwegian Regulation on Animal Experiment (FOR-2015-06-18-761). This course follows requirements in the Norwegian Regulation on Animal Experiment, § 24 and Annex E, Points 1-11. The course qualifies for the use of animals in research for persons with function A, B and D, in accordance with Articles 23 and 24 of the EU Directive 2010/63/EU, and adheres to the theoretical training requirements for Core Modules and Function Specific Modules for function A, B and D in the EU Education and Training Framework. (Function A = person carrying out procedures on animals, Function B = person designing procedures and projects, Function D = killing animals).
The course goal is to ensure ethical and humane use of experimental animals and generation of informative, objective and reproducible research whenever animals are used for experimental purposes. The complete MF9495 course consists of a theoretical part (MF9495T; Function A+B+D) and practical training (MF9495P; Function A+D). Students must sign up for both MF9495T and MF9495P to obtain a CAREiN Diploma certifying training required for working with research animals.
The theoretical part of the course provides training in mice, rats, pigs and model fish. Practical training will be given in rodents (mice and rats) and is a mandatory part of the course for all students that intent to conduct animal experiments themselves (Function A). Be aware that access to animal facilities requires completion of practical training in relevant species. Practical training in pigs and model fish (Function A+D) must be added and organized by the student according to directions by the course committee. Completed practical training with rodents (MF9495P) is a prerequisite for additional training in pigs and/or model fish, and cannot commence until such training is passed in a CAREiN accredited animal facility.
Note that the course provides theoretical training in the experimental use of mice, rats, pigs and model fish. The course does not qualify for experimental use of other animal species, including other fish species than model fish. Students that intend to work with other animal species must attend additional training in the use of the species in question, or attend an experimental animal course that covers the species in question.

Knowledge
The course will give you knowledge about methods for analysis of clustered data. More specifically, you will learn about

Analysis of summary measures (Area under the curve etc.)
Models for repeated measures in longitudinal design
Marginal models (including GEE)
Mixed models / multilevel models.

Skills
The course will give you the skills to:
Analyze correlated data by use of the Stata software. The course will mainly focus on longitudinal data, but other types of correlated data will also be discussed; among these the traditional multilevel designs. The course will concentrate on measurements on continuous scale and linear models, and on data of binary type and logistic models. We will focus on an intuitive understanding of the underlying statistical models rather than the mathematical details, with the goal of understanding the assumptions behind the analysis and the interpretation of the results.         
General competence
The course will make you able to understand the general ideas behind the analysis of correlated data, and to critically evaluate studies based on data of such type.
",,,"
Course content
A major assumption behind all traditional regression models is that of independent observations. However, this assumption may not hold in all situations. Often we will have some sort of clustered data where the independence assumption will not be fulfilled. Examples may be repeated measurements made on the same individual over time, multicenter studies where patients are nested within centres, genetic studies where we have information about family structures, or educational studies with pupils nested within classes, which are again nested in schools. Special sampling procedures, like cluster sampling, may also give rise to this type of data. Common to all these situations is that we will need some regression method that can handle the dependencies between observations. Mixed models are one means to this end. In many instances the terms multilevel models, hierarchical models, and random coefficient models also refer to mixed models, adapted to a given setting.
In this course we will give an introduction to the concept of mixed models. We will focus on the so-called linear mixed model with continuous, normally distributed outcomes. Further, we will introduce generalized linear mixed models, which apply to situations where the outcome variable is not necessarily continuous, such as logistic models for binary outcomes and log-linear models for counts. We will also introduce Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) as an alternative in certain situations.
The focus of the course will be on longitudinal studies, but we will also give examples from other types of studies where such methods are needed.

Understand the challenges and possibilities of causal mediation analysis.

",,,"
Course content
Causal inference is the task of drawing conclusions from data about the effects of treatments and other type of interventions. In epidemiology and clinical research, as well as in many other fields, formal methods for causal inference play an increasingly central role. This course gives an introduction to basic concepts and ideas in this area.
Among the topics being covered are:
 

randomization and target trials,
counterfactuals and estimands,
causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),
methods for confounding adjustment,
marginal structural models and time-dependent confounding,
causal mediation analysis,
causal inference in survival analysis.

The area of causal inference has over the last decades grown to be a very active area within statistics. Various new methods have been and are being developed, based on the seminal work by Donald Rubin, James Robins, Judea Pearl and others. This has led to new understandings of how statistical analysis is an integral part of causal inference and a continuously growing toolbox of methods for addressing causal questions.
In epidemiology and clinical research much knowledge about causal effects comes from statistical studies. The new tools give a more precise way of approaching these issues and can help researchers avoid common pitfalls. This course aim to make the participants acquainted with these methodological developments, both for the purpose of performing own research and for assessing the evidence from studies of treatment effects.

Learning outcome
The course has five main subjects:Causal graphs (DAGs), Modern Designs, Multiple Imputation, splines in regressions and Multilevel models. Also included are three minor subjects: Interaction, register epidemiology and an introduction to Stata.
Causal graphs introduce Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and will show examples of their use in medical research. DAGs are useful tools for understanding confounding, mediation and selection bias. A DAG analysis shows variables that should be adjusted for, and variables that should not be adjusted for.
The Design part will review classic research designs; cross sectional, cohort and case control. Focus will be on more advanced designs such as nested case control, case cohort and cross over designs. Strengths and weaknesses of the different designs will be discussed and examples of the different designs presented.
Multiple imputation: The lecture gives a short introduction to different missing-data mechanisms and how to handle missing data. The focus will be on multiple imputation, describing the concept of the method, how to choose a suitable imputation model, statistical inference, and challenges. Relevant Stata commands will be given and demonstrated through some examples.
Continuous variables and Splines: Categorizing continuous variables in a regression leads to loss of power. Instead, non-linear effects can be handled by using splines. We will provide Stata commands and examples of use.
Multilevel models gives an introduction to studies that lead to hierarchical data, what problem this gives in the analysis, and how to solve them. Focus is more on the interpretation of results than on the technical aspects of multi-level analysis.
The three last sessions will include workshops using Stata. Please bring your own laptops. Students associated with UiO will get access to Stata (via kiosk). We can work 2-3 persons per computer.

In this course we focus on four different, but inter-related, themes or debates in contemporary anthropology. Three of the themes are fixed (i.e., do not change) while the fourth theme changes from one year to another depending on who teaches the course. The course’s central aim is to give an expanded and strengthened grounding in general anthropology. The three fixed themes are:

Anthropology after Globalization
Ethnographies of the State
Modernity and the Persistent Life of Kinship

Through the course, you will work on issues like these:

First appearing in the English language in the 1940s, the term “globalization” is used to conceptualize and discuss the circulation of commodities, the rapid and furious exchange of ideas and images, and the movement of people. How do you define globalization? Why is globalization important for anthropology?
What is the “state” and how can we best study it?
How should one conceptualize and understand the relationship between kinship and “modernity”?
		In what ways does kinship continue to matter in the contemporary world, the world we all live in, today’s world?
How do contemporary anthropologists deal with history?
		What is history for anthropologists?
		Why is the concern with history important?

Course content
The past ten years has seen an explosion of anthropological interest in the workings of global financial markets and other economic institutions following the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. This crisis has also been an intellectual challenge for academic disciplines dedicated to understanding such processes. In particular, Economics was held to account for its failure to predict the impending crisis. In the aftermath of the crisis, ethnographic analysis has become increasingly important, particularily how economies are constructed in practise. This can be seen in the attention paid outside of our discipline to the work of writers such as Karen Ho and Gillian Tett. This course provides you with a unique overview of the theoretical developments of recent ethnographic work in this area whilst also preparing you to reflect on the methodological challenges of working in this growing field.
The course covers a number of key theoretical issues concerning financialisation, and the making of markets, including:

Morality and financialisation
The changing nature of the corporation
The construction, conversion and consumption of resources
The role of new financial technologies

Course content
This course will introduce students to some of the most exciting theoretical discussions in contemporary anthropology, which have to do with the status of images (both moving and still // film/video and photography) as a source of knowledge, research tool, and mode of representation. Rather than being mere illustrations (such as photos in the majority of anthropological literature), or indices of things, people or events (such as in mainstream documentary film), images are here understood as producing themselves knowledge, theory and argument. Such a renewed theoretical focus on and with images is required not only to understand our increasingly mediatized global world, but also the image use in radically different societies, and indeed by anthropologists themselves. The course will be useful not only for analysis of and with the visual in our global world, but also for students wanting to think through ‘visually’ their upcoming fieldwork, and when (post-fieldwork) writing their MA thesis.

Some people think economics is “all about the bottom line,” where the bottom line is necessarily about corporate profits and GDP. It’s certainly possible to use economics in that way. However, the tools of economics are also well-suited to helping solve the world’s environmental and natural resource problems. In this class, we will take a tour of the fields of environmental and natural resource economics. The objective of the course is to give you a taste of what the topics in these fields are, and how economic tools are useful in analyzing and solving problems in these fields. By the end of the semester, you will be able to approach a range of environmental and resource problems with the perspective of an economist, and I hope this will inform your engagement with the world’s important environmental policy debates.

The list of questions includes: Why and how has the world become increasingly unequal? Why did some countries industrialize before others? What was the role of income distribution, endowments and political institutions for economic progress? What role did high wages play to induce change? Why was it Europeans who conquered the world? How was the Americas incorporated into the global economy? Why has Africa remained the poorest region in the world?
This course addresses these and other similar questions using simple tools and by contrasting them to contemporary and modern economic theories for understanding the role of economic incentives, inequality and institutions for economic and social development.

The study of corporate governance is about the relationship between firms’ management, board of directors and investors, and how these relationships affect how firms operate and perform. This course puts particular emphasis on the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and long-term sustainability for the firm and the broader economy.
The first part of the course introduces fundamental principles of corporate governance, including the incentive problems in situations with asymmetric information. These issues are studied using the principal-agent models from contract theory. The course then proceeds to focus on recent empirical research on corporate governance, with a particular focus on sustainability and ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues. This includes topics on CEO pay, gender balance in the board room, and climate change.
The course combines fundamental theoretical models and recent empirical research with a practical approach to discuss topics that are widely debated both in academia, the private sector and the public sector.

This course provides an overview of behavioral economics. Behavioral economics incorporates descriptively accurate assumptions about cognitive ability, social interaction, moral motivation, and emotional responses into economic modeling and explores the implications of this for human behavior and economic outcomes. These assumptions are often motivated by empirical findings in psychology, sociology and related disciplines, as well as the field of experimental economics. Behavioral economics seeks to generate theoretical insights, make more accurate predictions of field phenomena, and suggest welfare improving policies.
Main topics:

Behavioral decision theory.
Time inconsistency and self-control.
Social preferences and fairness.

Political economics studies situations that arise when there is interaction between politics and economics.
We can then no longer only study the impact of different policies on the economy, as in conventional economic approaches, but also have to consider how different economic conditions shape policies.
The course introduces you to the most common ways to model politics formally and the application of these to the study of real world problems. The course also covers empirical testing of these models.

The class on Economic Dynamics and Uncertainty trains the student in dynamic economic thinking, intertemporal trade-offs, optimal and behavioral aspects of choice, and responses to uncertainty and learning. It draws from a variety of economic fields such as macroeconomics, asset pricing, behavioral economics, climate change economics, decision theory, and more. The overarching theme is the exploration, interpretation, and understanding of dynamic trade-offs in economic reasoning. Methodologically, the class starts with basic reasoning in two period models and moves on to dynamic programming in discrete and continuous time. The class applies similar methods and trade-offs to different economic settings in order to train the student in the application of concepts and methods outside of a narrow field or topical focus. The class pays particular attention to the fact that the future is uncertain. It explores implications of risk aversion, prudence, and Bayesian learning for decision making and economic dynamics. The seminars will make occasional use of Matlab. Students can use alternative programming language like Python or Julia if they do not require support.

The course emphasizes the dynamic process of historical change. The method is in part applied economics with a critical attitude towards timeless explanations of the wealth of nations.
The list of questions includes: Why and how has the world become increasingly unequal? Why did some countries industrialize before others? What was the role of income distribution, endowments and political institutions for economic progress? What role did high wages play to induce change? Why was it Europeans who conquered the world? How was the Americas incorporated into the global economy? Why has Africa remained the poorest region in the world?
This course addresses these and other similar questions using simple tools and by contrasting them to contemporary and modern economic theories for understanding the role of economic incentives, inequality and institutions for economic and social development.

Behavioral Economics seeks to enrich the standard model of the rational actor with stable preferences. Rather than assuming selfish rationality the behavior of economic agents are observed in experiments, usually in the lab but to an increasing extent in the field. This forms the basis for more elaborate theories of economic behavior where agents e.g. face problems of self-control, care about others and are influenced by reference points. The field is constantly evolving, new theories are developed and the empirical basis growing as more experiments are conducted, and the number of application is increasing. Any single course will of course never cover the entire field, but only focus on particular issues.

Learning outcome
This is an advanced PhD course which deals with various topics in quantitative macroeconomics. It aims at providing an overview of frontier methods and topics in macroeconomics, focusing on labor supply and labor economics in macroeconomics. The course will consist of several modules.
Module 1 will focus on the importance of occupations and specific human capital in understanding the level and dynamics of wage inequality. The material will introduce and analyze in great detail island-economy models. We will also study overall wage and earnings inequality through the aspect of between and within firm and occupation inequality.
Module 2 will study the sources of lifetime inequality and the determinants of individuals’ lifecycle earnings profiles. The material will focus on the importance of initial conditions, luck, human capital accumulation and individuals’ sorting across occupations.
Module 3 will focus on issues of labor supply with a particular focus on understanding the relative importance of the intensive and extensive margins of labor supply and on the effect of taxation and social security programs on cross-country differences in labor supply.
Module 4 will focus on the joint decision of occupational choice and labor supply. The analysis will motivate the importance of studying these decisions in one unified framework and introduce a simple Roy model consistent with the salient facts observed in the data. The model would then be extended to discuss issues related to gender gaps in occupational sorting, hours worked, and hourly wages.
Module 5 will focus on occupational choice and entrepreneurship. Standard models of occupational choice and entrepreneurship will be overviewed. Then the material will focus on the heterogeneity in entrepreneurial rates of return observed in the data and the implications on the effects of capital income and wealth taxation.
Module 6 will study the role of labor supply for risk sharing. The starting point is the standard incomplete market model. Risk sharing is manifested in labor supply and inequality. We will study the empirical evidence on inequality and labor supply.

Learning outcome
The inequality part of the course studies major developments in the economics of inequality, including the main drivers of inequality, the effects of inequality on consumption, wealth, and labor supply. We will also examine risk sharing and the extent to which households can protect themselves against risk. The role of public policy will be a central theme.The firm heterogeneity part of the course studies firm growth and its interaction with financial frictions, innovation, and economic development. The macro/labor part of the course studies unemployment, building on the search-matching framework of Diamond/Mortensen/Pissarides. The class covers macro- and microeconomic questions of the labor market combining theoretical and empirical methods. This includes seminal topic such as why unemployment fluctuates so much over the business cycle, why seemingly identical workers receive different wages, and whether the market allocates the right workers to the right jobs. The monetary economics part (Spring 2018) studies New Keynesian Heterogeneous Agent Models.

Course content
This course studies the role of heterogeneity and inequality in macroeconomics. We will focus on two central topics,
    1. economic inequality, consumption/risk sharing, and its implications for the macro economy
    2. firm heterogeneity and development
Macroeconomics has moved beyond the simple representative agent analysis and inequality is becoming an important part of the study of traditional macroeconomics topics such as growth and business cycles. For example, large household debt can contribute to and magnify macroeconomic fluctuations. This course will also study inequality in its own right. Macroeconomics with inequality opens up a range of new and interesting topics such as the factors behind the rising inequality, risk sharing through the market versus the welfare state, and the role of financial frictions for growth and development. We will study these central issues using the standard incomplete market model as a starting point.

Learning outcome
The students will be introduced to multi-disciplinary research covering technical and socio-economic aspects of implementing decentralized solar-based mini-grids in a rural setting in a developing country. The students will learn about:
1. Various energy system components, e.g. the solar panels (production), batteries (storage), and some basic applications (usage), includ-ing how the components work, their advantages, but also limitations and critical issues.
2. How these components function in a complete stand-alone system, design and dimensioning, adaptation, control system, energy flow, monitoring and safety mechanisms;
3. Central concepts of ethnographic methods such as participant observation, observation, open-ended and semi-structured interview techniques
4. The students will introduced to the qualitative approach that is how critical categories and meanings emerge from the ethno-graphic encounter rather than imposing meanings from existing models.
",,,"
Course content
Rural areas in developing countries often have limited access to electricity. A very promising option for making electricity available to rural areas is through the construction of renewable energy-based mini-grids. Solar photovoltaic (PV) based power is particularly interesting as solar PV has become a viable technology for meeting rural electrical need.
This course has a multidisciplinary focus and covers both technical and socio-economical aspects of implementing decentralized solar-based mini-grid, i.e. external to the national grid, in a rural context in a developing country.
The purpose of the course is to increase the students understanding of the interdependencies between technological energy solutions and social, economic geographic and cultural dimensions related to energy distribution and use, by offering lecturers; - on the technology component of decentralized solar-based mini-grid, including energy production, storage, distribution, and on - ethnographic methods, in the context of accommodating mini-grids to local micro-economies and local practices.
The course is divided in two main parts, where the first part takes place in the classroom at UiO and the second part involves the students in a field work situation in (country/village in India, with the purpose of observing how solar energy systems are integrated in a minigrid. In the field, the students will participate with researchers in ethnographic research methods on technology scoping and implementation. The focus in the field will be implementation of technology on household level. The field work will help to identify challenges and success factors at the local level for the implementation of mini-grids

Course content
This course is a compulsory component of the master’s degree in human geography. The purpose is to provide students with an overview of the range of scholarship done across geography’s sub-disciplines, and to illustrate similarities and differences in their theoretical foundations. The course starts by introducing the core concepts of space, place, scale and environment that help give coherence to geography, and a brief history of the discipline. The majority of the sessions are dedicated to an exploration of the geographical sub-disciplines and their theorical and methodological commitments. A common theme of borders ties the lectures together and shows the importance of theory for empirical research, with the aim of facilitating the development of the student’s own master’s thesis research project. The course finishes by introducing students to the fundamentals of research design: how to connect research questions, theory and methods. Lectures and seminars are given, including a seminar on master thesis topic development. 
 
Description of lectures
Session 1: Philosophy and the real world: making sense of geographical knowledges 
In this session we go through the intellectual and practical fundamentals of the course. An overview of key philosophy of science concepts ontology and epistemology is presented and how they are applied throughout the course. The idea of ‘borders’ is introduced and how it will be used throughout the course.

Session 2: Making territories, scales and places: core concepts in Geography 
This session provides an overview of core concepts that are considered central to how geography as a discipline is defined: space, place, scale and environment. The differences between Newtonian and Leibnizian conceptions of space and what they have meant for geographical theory and their application to research problems is considered. From these foundations, we look at place from regional theories to space-time. Throughout the influence of scale and how it is conceptualized is emphasized. The session concludes with the importance of human-environment interactions for geography. These concepts will also be applied in the sub-disciplinary lectures so here only an introduction to them is provided.

Session 3: How did we get here? A history of geographical thought 
This session will start with briefly describing the historical origins of geography as a scientific discipline, and introduce the distinction between analytical sciences studying certain aspects of phenomena and chronological/chorological sciences that study associations between diverse phenomena in time (history) and space (geography). It will proceed to reflect on debates and tensions that have been reoccurring in the history of the discipline, concerning, for instance, nature-society relationships, the balance between nomothetic and ideographic approaches, and emphasis on place or space as the object of study. The lecture will then delve into shifting research traditions in the more recent history of human geography: How each tradition evolved in response to internal disciplinary debates and changing external (societal) circumstances, and built on interrelated ontological and epistemological assumptions reflected in methodological choices. A discussion of relevance for research design choices today will conclude the lecture.

Session 4: Complexity, quantification and growth (Economic Geographies) 
Economic geography is concerned with describing, analyzing and explaining (uneven) economic development ‘in real places’. Inherently, this involves moving beyond the distinction between nomothetic (emphasis on general forces at play) and ideographic (attention to the specific/unique) approaches in geography. This session delves into key ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of this, including the need to draw on, re-theorize and/or synthesize concepts and perspectives from other social sciences to acknowledge the complexity and multi-scalar nature of socio-economic processes as the play out in different places. The lecture will also reflect specifically on ‘boundaries’ in economic geography: On the one hand, how the discipline tends to see (administrative, cognitive, social, institutional) boundaries that effect and are themselves affected by multi-scalar socio-economic processes – for instance, what are the ‘real places’, and how are they constructed? On the other, how boundaries constructed within, or at the intersection between, disciplines (e.g. those delineating economic geography from economics) have influenced on how such processes are studied.

Session 5: Geography, authoritarianism and the fault-lines of truth (Political Geographies)
This lecture will focus on the authoritarian (re)turn in Europe from a geographical perspective, with a particular focus on its association with disinformation and conspiracy theories. I will start by discussing some of the literature on the rise of authoritarian populism, focusing on demographic, cultural and economic grievance explanations of the phenomenon. I will then turn to the strategies deployed by authoritarians to delegitimize opponents and to create the impression that they alone are viable leaders of their respective countries. Finally, I will discuss how authoritarian (strategic) narratives reproduce the conditions for conflict by focusing on the frontline cities in Ukraine, where these narratives (and the disinformation associated with them) are brought to the extreme.

Session 6: Border crossings, workplace attachments and labour agency (Labour geography)
Strauss (2020) argues that it is time for labour geographers to become more explicit about their ontological and epistemological foundations and the intellectual/theoretical and political implications of such. We will discuss our own research in light of her concern, shedding light on what different conceptions of borders mean to the agency of temporary agency workers. As in labour geography, a relational and spatial ontology is called for in a new paradigm of global development in development geography. The empirical point of departure is that the world is woven more tightly together through chains and networks. Hence, we will also discuss what trans border networks mean for the agency of the temporary agency workers.

Session 7: The formation of imaginative and factual borders, bounded places in the city and its region (Urban Geographies) 
Urban studies is an important field for human geographers, because of the importance of urban processes for humans and environments in an increasingly urbanized world, and because geographers make important contributions to the understanding the complexity of cities. Within urban policy and planning there is a growing interest for issues that urban geographers traditionally have been working with, like segregation, gentrification, place-making and social exclusion. New policy agendas focusing on urban sustainability have also stirred an intellectual debate about the social implications of climate mitigation strategies and the green shift, where geographers make important contributions. In this session we explore the conceptualization, production and implications of borders within urban geography. We will use borders as a lese to take a closer look at spatial, representational and social structures in the city. We will especially focus on the formation of bounded and exclusionary elite enclaves in cities like Sao Paulo, Johannesburg, London and Oslo, and how imaginative and political borders and boundaries, for example between the city, its surburbs and peri-urban hinterland, limit urban sustainability policies. The compact city model and policy will be used as a case. 
The formation of places within the city, where we could focus on elite enclaves and spaces:

Session 8: Power, inequalities and identities: making sense of difference (Feminist and Decolonial Geographies)
This session covers a range of scholarship in the constructivist tradition that deals with questions of social exclusion. Feminist and post colonial geographers pioneered a number of research topics and insisted on the importance of social exclusion and the everyday to understanding large scale processes like capitalism, colonialism and neo-liberalism. Now, a wide range of scholarship building from feminist, queer theory, race and indigenous studies, and decolonial thinking is significantly challenging other kinds of critical theory. Here, the way that social borders are created and reinforced is central to the operation of power. This session is intended to provide a foundation and an overview so students can peruse in more depth those debates most intriguing. We will talk about how this literature can help conceptually to make sense of social exclusions and social borders.

Session 9: Environment, sustainability and socionatures (Environmental Geographies) 
Human-environment relations lie at the core of geography and today encompass a wide range of scholarship. Here we confront straight on the intellectual border between ‘society’ and ‘nature’. From work on climate change and resilience to more than human ethnographies and affect, it contributes to intellectual debates that span the entire theoretical spectrum within the discipline. In this session we briefly review some of this diversity and then focus in on political ecology. Political ecology emerged in conversation with development and feminist studies and today has split into two main camps. One which is concerned with showing the social politics of environmental issues, the other which is concerned with how socionatural entanglements occur and change. We will explore these literatures and think about society-nature borders relate to core sustainability challenges.

Particular emphasis is placed on understanding correlations between social, cultural and economic changes (such as postmodern urban development and globalization) on the one hand, and on the other hand the growth of new forms of urban policies and town planning (such as entrepreneurship policy, governance, postmodern planning processes, neighbourhood strategies, liberalized housing policies, a focus on spectacular architecture and new urbanism) in cities in the western world. The course also deals with challenges related to architectural design, urban design and town planning at a low geographical level, whether in respect of blocks of flats in central areas or suburban development. A key issue is what kind of urbanism results from a more privatized and pluralistic town planning. At the same time, the significance of the local context is highlighted. Specific examples are given, also from Norway, of how new planning ideals and models are implemented. Emphasis is also put on exemplifying and discussing the contextual assumptions of the theory.

Course content
This course examines the dynamics and forms of democratization in developing countries, with special emphasis on the politics of democratic transition, deepening and decline. The first part of the course focuses on drivers and modalities of democratization and representation. This is followed by a section that examines the contemporary forms and dynamics of autocratization – democratization in reverse – and the sources of resilience and resistance against autocratization. The last part of the course studies international engagement in democratization and peacebuilding and the links between democratization/autocratization and (il)liberal peacebuilding. Throughout the course there is a focus on the interplay between key political actors (elites, political parties, civil society organizations) and their political spaces (institutions, discourses, alliances etc.) and how these relations produce and transform democracies/autocracies. Primary attention is given to popular actors in civil society and their political strategies.
The course draws on interdisciplinary literature and debates, while also foregrounding political geographic approaches and contributions. The course is designed to give a broad overview of the field and a theoretical basis for master degree studies in human geography within the field of democratization and civil society in developing studies.

General competences
This course will enable you

to apply critical thinking and a geographical sensitivity to a fast-changing world economy, as seen from the standpoint of workers.

",,,"
Course content
In this course, you will learn about the political and economic geographies of labour in the fast-changing world we live in. Diverse processes impact the world of work: globalization and economic restructuring drives flexibilisation of firms and deregulation of labour markets, new technologies transform labour processes and employment relations, while climate change represent a fundamental challenge to workplaces and working lives.
Workers are not helpless onlookers to these changes. The course draws inspiration from the labour geography tradition and its focus on the agency of workers, i.e. their capability to make a difference. Workers’ ability to engage with and resist changes that affect them is circumscribed by structural conditions, however, and through readings, presentations and discussions, you will learn more about labour regulation and worker resistance in very different contexts, for instance domestic labour, platform work, climate jobs and identity politics.
A spatial perspective runs through the course. Concepts such as scale, borders, networks and (work)places will be presented at the outset of the course module, and will accompany our collective efforts to make sense of the politics of work in a number of cases and geographical contexts. Moreover, the title “The futures of work” implies that we take the temporalities of these politics seriously, and see historical cases in relation to the political present, as well as possible future scenarios.
Finally, the course places particular focus on three additional analytical concepts – worker agency, labour regime and representation – and encourages students to familiarise themselves with these concepts, and discuss and reflect on their meaning and use. While the course draws on research literature from across the world, it also aims to connect scholarly accounts with students’ own work experiences and/or employment outlook.

Course content
The global balance of economic power is shifting towards the East and the South, and economic globalization is said to be entering a new phase. What does this mean? How do we, as human geographers, identify such processes, and how can we help to analyze and explain them? This course is based on the global chains and networks perspective, comprising of the global value chains (GVC) approach and the global production networks approach(GPN). We study how analytical frameworks constructed around chains and networks can be used to explain the changes. These approaches build on grand theories on the transformation of economic systems. They also require the development of middle-range theories in order to facilitate explanations in specific analyses. During the course, we will demonstrate and discuss how this can be achieved. The theoretical scope of the course is wide-ranging and forms a basis for human geography research in several different contexts.

University of Oslo,UIO,Social Sciences,Case Study Research Methods,8,,,[],,,,,"
Course content
The central goal of the seminar is to enable students to create and critique methodologically sophisticated case study research designs in the social sciences. To do so, the seminar will explore the techniques, uses, strengths, and limitations of case study methods, while emphasizing the relationships among these methods, alternative methods, and contemporary debates in the philosophy of science. The research examples used to illustrate methodological issues will be drawn primarily from international relations and comparative politics. The methodological content of the course is also applicable, however, to the study of history, sociology, education, business, economics, and other social and behavioral sciences.
The seminar will begin with a focus on the philosophy of science, theory construction, theory testing, causality, and causal inference. With this epistemological grounding, the seminar will then explore the core issues in case study research design, including methods of structured and focused comparisons of cases, typological theory, case selection, process tracing, and the use of counterfactual analysis. Next, the seminar will look at the epistemological assumptions, comparative strengths and weaknesses, and proper domain of case study methods and alternative methods, particularly statistical methods and formal modeling, and address ways of combining these methods in a single research project. The seminar then examines field research techniques, including archival research and interviews.

University of Oslo,UIO,Social Sciences,Mixed and Merged Methods: Toward a Methodological Pluralism,8,,,[],,,,,"
Course content
From the 1990s Mixed Methods Research (the integration of “qualitative and quantitative approaches or methods in a single study or a program of inquiry” - Tashakkori and Creswell 2007: 4) is a well-known and established field but it also remains a hot topic in contemporary social science. However, it is not a novelty in the methodological landscape.
Historically, since the making of social research and until the late 1930s, mixed methods were a common practice for almost one century: Frédéric Le Play (1840s), Eilert Sundt (1850s), Charles Booth (1886), B. Seebohm Rowntree (1899), Max Weber (1907), the Chicago School (1920s), Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Marie Jahoda and Hans Zeisel, Rensis Likert, Helen Merrel and Robert S. Lynd (1930s) used mixed methods.
After disappearing for forty years, mixed methods had their renaissance in the 1990s. However, their second wave is rooted in important experiences and practices of the past, without which the philosophy and epistemological foundations of contemporary mixed methods research cannot be fully understood.
The course will give an overview about current debates and the key issues in the field. Firstly, an alternative classification (of the main methodologies currently used in social sciences) will be proposed, aiming to overcome the outdated dichotomy qualitative-quantitative. Then, the conventional quantitative language of social research (shaped by terms such as 'measurement', 'hypothesis', ‘indicators’, ‘variable', ‘sampling’, ‘generalization’, ‘validitiy’ and so on) will be revisited in the light of a new epistemological framework, adding new meanings/concepts (to these positivistic terms) compatible also with qualitative approaches (Gobo 2018). Because the re-joining of qualitative and quantitative approaches in a new methodological ground [which it has been called “third paradigm” (Tashakkori and Teddlie 1998, Greene and Caracelli 2003, Morgan 2007, Creswell and Plano Clark 2011)] can be achieved only by merging some languages, procedures, codes and mindsets of these two paradigms. Not simply mixing or juxtaposing methods (as suggested by the naïve pragmatism waved by many scholars). The latter can only unavoidably lead to an ‘epistemological jam’ and to a naïve ‘methodological bricolage’. According to Greene (2007) and also Maxwell’s spirit: “the main value of mixed method research, as Greene (2007) argued, is in creating a dialogue between different ways of seeing, interpreting, and knowing, not simply in combining different methods and types of data” (2010: 478).
Course participants will acquire skills and competencies in order to design a fully mixed methods study and develop an appropriate strategy to answer specific research questions. In this regard, some little-known techniques (“inter-vey”, calendar interviewing, Delphi method, mystery shopper), classified as “merged methods” (Gobo 2015), will be showed. They are particularly interesting because could represent an overpassing of the qualitative and quantitative divide, by the fact they embody in one single method the advantages of either approaches or methods (Gobo 2016).
Finally, it will be argued how mixed methods are useful for decolonizing contemporary methodology and why they are particularly suitable for studying multicultural societies.
During the course, participants (if they wish) will have the chance to share own ideas and plans regarding a mixed methods design (e.g. a PhD project, a fieldwork problem and so on) and receive comments, suggestions and advice emerging from the collective debate.

Course content
This course is an introduction to collecting and analyzing ""big data"" for social scientists. Over the last decade, the variety and types of data available to researchers have exploded. This includes not only contemporary data, such as from websites and social media platforms, but also historical data, from digitized interviews to 19th century newspapers. At the same time, analytic techniques from computer science are increasingly being used to solve social science problems.
One week is not enough time to master the techniques for collecting and analyzing big data. You will, however, be able to establish the foundation for developing these skills. The course is designed as a practical overview. The emphasis each class will be on applying the specific techniques rather than on their mathematical basis. The course will provide an overview in that each lesson will introduce a new method in order to demonstrate the range of methods. Combined, students will have the skills and resources to apply these methods to theoretically-relevant problems in the social sciences.

",,,"
Course content
‘Nordic civil society – a model for the world?’ studies the role of civil society associations in Norden and beyond, and their roles in relation to the Nordic model of society. Focusing on voluntary associations’ roles between the state, the market and the private sphere, we wish to explore new perspectives on ideas and practices which often are understood as particularly Nordic.
The high membership rates in voluntary associations makes the Nordic countries ideal cases for investigating links between civil society and democratic governance. In the Nordic countries, the nexus between state and civil societies has had consequences for the Nordic model of society, for co-operation within the Nordic region, and for Nordic global engagement. The course studies these dynamics and consequences, asking how civil societies’ global, transnational and regional interactions may have shaped ideas about Norden.
The course is organised in a format comprising lectures and seminars. The lectures will focus on the course curriculum, while the seminars will be in-depth discussions of literature and the PhD candidates’ own essays.

After completing the course, students will be able to:
a) identify and assess the wide-ranging ways in which the climate emergency has been addressed through education to date, alongside factors to consider for the prospects of current and new proposals,
b) assess the theoretical and empirical bases for these approaches, drawing on a broad base of disciplinary perspectives when examining their fitness-for-purpose, priority and likely impact,
c) identify key findings and insights that contribute to the development of more meaningful responses and hope-filled action in and through educational settings,
d) articulate their own research issues, dispositions, preferences and perspectives in relation to the challenge of addressing climate change through education.
",,,"
Course content
The notion that climate change education is crucial to redirecting teaching and learning in the face of today’s climate emergency is now widely established and accepted. Yet despite broad agreement among experts, citizens, educationalists and activists about (i) its necessity within a suite of prevention, mitigation and adaptation strategies, and (ii) a need to focus on ensuring strategic (rather than piecemeal) action, there can appear to be little consensus in public, political and academic spheres about: 
a) what should and shouldn’t happen in climate change education, be that day-by-day or over the longer term,
b) who is responsible for ensuring quality climate change education takes place, 
c) how to bring about change in educators’ practices to ensure climate change education is educational, fit for purpose, and effective,
d) the intended and unintended outcomes of the current provision and reach of climate change education on those involved in it, as well as those beyond it, and
e) what and how to assess, evaluate and research climate change education.

Drawing on studies of educational theory and practice, child development to organisational learning, examinations of the influence of family, culture, social networks and settings, critiques of policy documents and textbooks, the role of social movements and public engagement (and much more besides), this course exemplifies how research is crucial to addressing points (a-e).

The course will identify and assess various:
• starting points for addressing the climate emergency through education
• approaches to climate change education (and distinguish between what works, might work and doesn't work)
• influences on educator beliefs, motivations, professional development, and practices
• factors shaping values, beliefs, knowledge and action among learners and through schools, and
• responses in universities, including institutional priorities, student experiences, and teaching and research opportunities.

Key considerations in this course include the developing focus on the significance of ‘pyropedagogies’ - what is expected of education 'when our house is on fire' (Greta Thunberg) and hopeful ‘practice architectures’ for addressing the contemporary climate emergency through education. Lectures and workshops will underscore the value of the cross-fertilisation of ideas, by working with insights from many disciplines in ensuring climate change education is fit for purpose.

",,,"
Course content
This seminar will examine the ethics and politics of care.  We will not begin with the presumption that care is a self-evident good.  Nor is our goal to posit a definitive theory of care.  Rather, we will treat care as we and our informants often do in our everyday lives: as a problematic concerning the distribution of moral responsibility across social, cultural, political and economic boundaries.  We will thus use the concept as a springboard into the ethnographic exploration of political and ethical life and of different governing regimes of life itself. We will consider ethnographic accounts of humanitarianism, care work, biopolitics, repair work, extinction, social reproduction, and other topics, exploring who is obliged to care for whom, with what effects, and in accordance with what moral/ethical logics, regimes of personhood, and modes of politicization.  Along the way we will also consider care in relation to other core concepts such as harm, giving, value, exchange, coercion, vulnerability, hospitality, sovereignty, responsibility, dependency and interdependency.  Ultimately, I am interested in cultivating ethnographic sensibilities around the question, How is care’s morality established in practice and how is moral responsibility assigned and distributed in different care regimes.  I would like us to speculate as well about why care has surfaced recently as both an object of ethnographic inquiry and a new moral and political imperative.

Course content
The predominant discourse today says that democracy is in crisis. But the world is much more democratic than 200 years ago, and there is obviously much variation in how rulers get access to political power and how they use it. A better understanding of these differences is arguably one of the most interesting and important topics for social scientists. Against this backdrop, this course explores the who, what, when, where, and why of political regimes based on an explicit comparative perspective. It provides an advanced introduction to different ways of conceptualizing and measuring political regimes. Moreover, the course offers an overview of variations in democracy and autocracy across time and countries and a discussion of the potential determinants of this variation. Finally, the course explores the consequences of different regime types for human desires and miseries, such as economic growth, human development, state repression, and conflict. During the week, the participants will get the chance to discuss how these issues relate to their own projects.

Illustrate arguments with examples and empirical case studies from around the world

",,,"
Course content
How are we to understand the making of urban policy in a globalizing world?
In what ways do policies emerge in one place and then appear and reappear in other locations? What happens to policies as they travel between places? Who is involved in the construction of “best practice” examples and what do they reveal about the uneven power geographies of policy-making? It is to answering these questions, and related others, that a new sub-field of urban studies has emerged over the last two decades. This lies at the intersection of, on the one hand, the re-thinking of notions of place along relational lines, and, on the other, the re-thinking of what an attention to the city in the at and the making-up of urban policy. “[U]rban policy mobility studies”, as Jacobs (2012: 418) terms this work, is one strand to a broader approach centred on a relational urban geographical scholarship. It takes aim at traditional accounts of urban policy and politics. It is argued that this earlier work tended to privilege proximate relations over those from further afar. This is not surprising. Bringing into view more novel geographies of urban policy-making, however, involves not just leaving city hall – as those working on issues of governance have long argued – but also leaving the city itself. In addition, urban policy mobility studies junk the positivist/rationalist-formalist work on policy transfer, and replace it with a post- positivist /-rationalist-constructive approach. It argues that the former rests on rather narrow typologies, is insufficiently sensitive to the socially produced nature of geographical scale and underplays the extent to which policies are constituted through movement.
This course historicizes the emergence of this new sub-field of global urban policy mobilities. It introduces and discusses its intellectual origins, from across anthropology, human geography, political science, planning and sociology, before setting out its central features. The methodological consequences of understanding the making of urban policy in a global-urban context is explored before the course turns to particular case studies. These exemplify both how policies emerge, travel and appear and reappear in places, and the range of methods that have been used to study the phenomenon. It concludes by thinking through what the future of this sub-field might be in a COVID- 19 urban world.

",,,"
Course content
The past twenty-five years have seen a host of new digitally mediated fields becoming available to researchers in the social sciences and humanities. The shift is not only in the volume of digital traces, which is admittedly dramatic, but very much also in the kind of digital empirical material, we can now work with. Rather than having more of the same, and having it digitized, we are faced with a staggering and ever-evolving array of natively digital empirical material, born from social media platforms, search engines, mobile devices, sensors, etc., and thus shaped by the socio-technical infrastructures of these media environments.

While these new types of data hold great research potential, especially for fields and approaches interested in mundane traces of everyday life (e.g. anthropology), they also entail a set of methodological challenges. Indeed, both challenges and potentials are significantly compounded by the fact computational techniques like machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, or computer vision have made it possible to work with conventionally qualitative data types (e.g. text, images or social interactions) in quantitative ways. Or, seen from a different angle, that these techniques have made the qualitative exploration of very large corpora feasible.

One strand of research that has taken a particular interest in the application of computational techniques to the analysis of digitally born material is the study of public knowledge controversies. This is partly due to the fact that such controversies are everywhere on the internet, but also because controversies typically involve a very heterogeneous and distributed cast of actors forming coalitions and alliances around an equally heterogeneous distributed set of issues. They are, in short, both complex and dynamic situations. The liveliness, richness, and granularity of online debates, combined with the power of computation to find patterns in these messy data streams, therefore hold great potential for controversy mapping.

The course introduces you to digital controversy mapping and its broader societal relevance, discusses the role of computation in a traditionally qualitatively inclined field and gives you hands-on experience with the newest tools and techniques.

Course content
The course gives students the opportunity to gather first-hand experience with psychological research. Students will either jointly conduct a group research project or do a research internship.
The course has three goals: (1) familiarize students with all stages of the research process; (2) strengthen research methods and quantitative methods skills; and (3) convey knowledge in the project topics from the fields of cognitive, developmental, or social psychology.
The course uses a project-based approach. Students collect and analyse their own data. The course is based on the idea that methods skills are best trained by conducting research oneself.
If doing a group project, students work in groups of about 12 students on one concrete research questions under the supervision of one researcher. Students choose the topic from a list of offered topics, read and evaluate relevant literature, develop research question and hypotheses, plan a study and develop materials, run the study and collect data, analyse the data, and present and discuss results to their fellow students.
If doing a research internship, students work directly with one researcher on a project that they develop together, and go through the same steps.
Researchers from cognitive, developmental, and social psychology participate in teaching the course. Not all fields may be represented in each semester. After being admitted to the course, students will be informed on what researchers will offer projects and internships, will be asked to rank-order their preference, and then be assigned to a project. (It will not always be possible to follow individual preferences.)
Before the project, a set of four lectures refreshes knowledge on research methods and quantitative methods, introduces open science methods, and orients in how to plan research.
At the conclusion of the course, students from both the group project path and the internship path meet for a final symposium where they present their work in a pecha kucha style presentation and in a poster session.
When run for the first time in Autumn 2022, the group projects will only offer projects using quantitative methods. Later edition may include also qualitative projects.
The initial 4 lectures will be given in English. Group projects may be given in English or Norwegian. Language of assignments, presentation and posters can be chosen by students.

",,,"
Course content
Judgment and decision making (JDM) is a branch of cognitive psychology. Much of cognitive psychology gives a purely descriptive account on how people think. In contrast, JDM research focuses on readily observable judgments and decisions and also address whether these behaviors are consistent with how people should think. For example, memory psychologists investigate how information is categorized in memory. JDM researchers interested in memory focus on how memory influences judgments and decisions. Judgments and decisions are an essential part of most professions. JDM research is therefore highly relevant to applied disciplines in various fields, including health care, organizational behavior, computer science, economics, law etc.
The course may also contains topics in Social Cognition (SC) and the social context of thinking. SC lies in the intersection between social and cognitive psychology and deals with how we perceive, interpret, describe, and explain events and actions related to self and others in daily life. SC is the study of such questions as: How do we make judgments about the characteristics of ourselves and other people? How do we figure out what other people are thinking and feeling? What role do our self-concepts and our various goals and motives play in guiding our behavior?
This course examines research literature on selected topics within JDM, SC and the social context of thinking. The students are expected to participate in the general discussion following each topic presentation.

Dissemination and communication of research to the public constitutes one of the core functions of the university. Neuroscientists engage in conversations with society through writing, talks, and participation in media, thus benefiting various parts of our community. But communication skills also benefit scientists. Communicating your own work makes you more aware of what you are actually working on. Communicating general topics to people who are not familiar with psychology and neuroscience helps you broaden your scope, and inspires new research questions. Communicating your skills may also come in handy when applying for jobs inside and outside of academia. In this course, you will learn some of the genres of research communication and dissemination within various media, including popularized essays, op-eds, public talks and interviews.

Finally, the students will acquire the ability to discuss phenomena of hemispheric specialisation in context concepts of cognitive psychology (and vice versa)

",,,"
Course content
The left and right cerebral hemispheres differ in their information processing abilities. Some cognitive functions, like speech and language processing, are predominately relying on temporal and frontal regions of the left hemisphere, while others, e.g. spatial processing and face recognition, are considered right-hemispheric functions. In this, these so-called functional brain asymmetries represent a fundamental characteristic of brain organisation and theories of human cognition can only be complete when acknowledging these processing differences between the hemispheres. The present course provides an overview to classical findings as well as an introduction to modern approaches to studying functional brain asymmetries. The seminar will cover inter-individual differences in brain asymmetry in healthy and clinical populations, address intra-individual changes across the lifespan, and discuss evolutionary origins of asymmetry. Also, the role of the interaction between the hemisphere via the corpus callosum for establishing and maintaining hemispheric asymmetries will be discussed. Across all topics, the course connects phenomena of hemispheric asymmetry with concept widely used in cognitive psychology (e.g., working memory, attention) with the aim to establish an integrated cognitive neuroscience perspective on hemispheric differences.

",,,"
Course content
Doing psychological research and applying psychological science in any field requires thorough knowledge of central theories and evidence, but also knowledge and skills in how to apply these theories and evidence to concrete societal problems. In particular, researching concrete social phenomena through the lens of social psychology, and applying social psychology in a scientific way, requires three building blocks:

connecting theory and evidence to observations in the field
understanding how interventions based on these insights can be developed
understanding how the impact of interventions can be evaluated

These three building blocks combine knowledge of theory and empirical evidence with more general knowledge about research methods, statistics, and evaluation methods. They also require a critical perspective on the reach and limits of social psychological theorizing. In this course, students learn about these three basic building blocks of social-psychological science in an integrated way.
Whether you desire a career as a research scientist or a consultant, this course will provide you with valuable knowledge and the necessary skillset to fulfill these roles.

Course content
Urban challenges today are complex and multi-faceted. They need to be addressed by combining knowledge from different disciplines to ensure responses are valuable, operational and inclusive.
In this course, students aim to construct and execute a project relating to municipal strategies and urban challenges in Oslo. The projects must engage with people or a place outside of the studio and may be an experimental, critical or creative response to a local problem. Students work on this project in interdisciplinary groups (of three or four). Groups have a key contact at the City of Oslo and in-studio supervision to support project development.
The course progresses through context and skill building, project formation, project implementation and reporting. At the end of the semester, project groups present and submit a written project report to the City of Oslo. Students also submit an individual report.
The main components of the course are:

Urban Knowledge – including knowledge about the City of Oslo's structure, strategies and challenges by engaging with Oslo city staff, accompanied with learning and applying related theories in urban studies and planning.
Project Work - students experience creating a project from start to finish in a group. This is done by identifying and framing problems, creating and concretizing a response through design processes, project planning and managing various activities to implement and test the project concept.
Communications – including group facilitation, professional relationship development, presentations, visual communications, and non-academic writing.

The course uses multiple tools for learning, including dialogue, applied theory, reflections, design processes, workshops and learning by doing. As students combine and apply knowledge to an authentic context through project work, in-depth understanding and practical applicability develops.
This is an immersive full-time course. The course is open to students from multiple institutions.

Course content
*After spring 2022, the course will hibernate and run again in the autumn semester, starting autumn 2023*
This course studies how economic globalisation and technological change interact in shaping development at the level of regions and countries. The book ""Global Shift"" by Peter Dicken is the main text used.
The first part of the course defines economic globalisation as growing functional interdependencies between countries and regions in the world economy. It proceeds to maps contemporary trends, including the entry of countries such as China and India as major players.
The second part is more theoretical, discussing specifically the role of multinational companies and more generally the question of industry localization in light of modern space-shrinking transportation and communication technologies. The role of the state in regulating and facilitating economic globalization will be thoroughly discussed. Critical questions concerning who are the winners and losers in ongoing global shifts are reflected upon, with emphasis on how the policies, industrial structures and institutional conditions of regions and countries determine whether they benefit or not. Finally, economic globalisation will be discussed in the context of social and environmental sustainability challenges.

Course content
This course focuses on human-environment relationships and their implications for nature and society.  The issue of climate change will be a focal point for examining the drivers and consequences of environmental change, including relationships to processes such as globalization, urbanization, and land use changes. Scientific concepts, such as the “Anthropocene,” which are increasingly used to describe the nature and extent of contemporary environmental challenges, will be explored from a social science perspective. Other topics such as consumption, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, impacts, vulnerability, resilience, adaptation and mitigation will be presented and related to the broader debates about transitions and transformations to sustainability.
The lectures, readings and seminars will explore how environmental discourses influence understandings and responses to contemporary environmental problems, including the role of beliefs, values, and worldviews in shaping the rules, norms, institutions, policies and power relationships, which can either promote or constrain practical responses to environmental challenges. Students will actively engage with debates on and experiments with individual and collective change, and explore what alternative approaches and paradigms have to offer.

Course content
To move towards a sustainable future, new types of innovation are called for – innovations that address the “grand challenges” while also taking into account the environmental and social consequences of new innovations. Can we innovate our way to a diverse, low-carbon, green society? This course will explore the relationship between innovation and the environment, including the potential to move toward a “green economy”. The role of both technological and social innovations in response to problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and land use change will be critically assessed.
The first module of the course presents the context for innovation in the 21st Century, providing the historical and scientific background of the serious environmental challenges facing society. Diverse perspectives will be presented on the role of new technologies and green innovations as a response to environmental problems.
The second module will introduce the major approaches to innovation studies. The institutionalization of innovation will also be discussed, with an emphasis on the role of learning, knowledge, and policy.
The third module looks at empirical studies of green innovations, including new energy technologies such as wind and solar power. New transportation technologies and innovations in the food sector, will be discussed.
Finally, the fourth module will critically assess the potentials and limits of innovations as a response to environmental problems, and discuss the role of social innovation in transformations to sustainability. The course will consist of ten lectures and four seminars. In the seminars, each student will choose an example of an innovation in Norway and assess it from the perspective of its environmental and social impacts, leading to a short paper and presentation. The literature will consist of both articles and book chapters. It is recommended that students have taken  SGO2200 – Economic globalisation and regional development.

They will also acquire experience in giving oral academic presentations and receive feedback on their academic writing.
",,,"
Course content
The course focuses on how workers can engage with and selectively rework structural constraints through mobilization, organization and ways of coping. Workers are brought into relation with ever-new groups of subjects in a contemporary world economy that is simultaneously marked by connectivity and fragmentation. A central concept in this PhD course is that of ‘constrained agency’, which we use to show how labour does in fact have the ability to act on globalized structures, but in ways that are circumscribed by borders of different kinds, networked economic relations organised at different spatial scales, and systems of social reproduction. The course will introduce the basic concepts of agency and structure and apply them to the sub-discipline of labour geography. We will also show how new conceptual advances from across the social sciences have an unsettling effect on how we view agency and structure, helping to pave the way for a decentered and decolonized understanding of labour agency in geography. The course provides a learning context whereby academic interventions are coupled with active student engagement and encounters with actors and sites in the world of work.

",,,"
Course content
This course gives an introduction to the Nordic social and welfare state models. How do we assess current challenges and crises? Are the very foundations for democracy changing? Why, how and to what extent have the Nordic models been reformed and transformed?
Empirically, the course will be focusing on work, family, immigration, labour relations, economic policies, pensions, schooling and gender equality.
Theoretically, the course is informed by comparative welfare state research and political economy. We will focus on contemporary debates on the sustainability of Nordic welfare state models in the context of challenges such as the ongoing pandemic, ageing, flows of immigrants and asylum seekers, financial internationalization, climate crisis and relations to the EU single market.

What are the historical roots of the Nordic states, and how did their political and welfare systems develop in the 20th century?
What social conflict lines, alliances and compromises created the post-war context of highly organized civil societies (centralized labour unions and employers associations, strong organizations of farmers and fishermen), linked to the state in patterns of democratic corporatism.
How is work and family life reconciled in the setting of the Nordic welfare state?
What policy reforms have been agreed on in order to respond to present challenges?
Are the ambitions of gender equality and universalist welfare provisions sustainable in the future?

Learning aims
The Nordic countries are often associated with successful policies for growth and equality. Their social structures maintain high trust and the state secures generous welfare and safety for all citizens. But a closer look at popular debates reveal diverging judgments: For some “the Nordic Model” represents a formula for success where economic growth, democratic rule, norms of equality, social welfare, a highly skilled labor force, gender equality, and high quality of living have been successfully combined. For others, it represents overblown paternalistic, homogenous – quasi-socialist – welfare states which tax their citizens far too much. Others again, argue that Nordic politicians have given up on many of the ideals of the model as they have introduced neo-liberal reforms. Reflecting on both the history and the contemporary challenges of the region, the aim of the course is that the students should be able to critically assess various idealized accounts of Nordic peculiarities. The course will provide students with information and knowledge that enables them to discuss the similarities and differences between the Nordic countries and contrast their experience with that of other European countries.

Are the participants ideologically convinced before they join or is ideological conviction a result of participation? What do we actually know about radicalization processes? How do sectarian conflicts erupt? What are the similarities and differences in stereotypical portrayals of religious minority groups, and how is race, culture and difference linked to islamophobia and antisemitism? And which role do women typically have in extremist religious groups? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this course.
In order to understand religious fundamentalism, extremism and violence, we will discuss different perspectives that have been used in empirical studies: social psychology, cultural analysis, and social movements.
This course will provide useful knowledge and skills for people who work in education, research, the media, public administration, the health and social services, business, politics, and international affairs.

",,,"
Course content
An ever larger part of our time and our social and professional lives takes place on the internet. This goes for our love lives, for our interaction with friends and acquaintances, for our participation in democratic and public debate - or in almost any other debate; it goes for our relation to the politicians we elect, our use of news media and our search for knowledge and information; just as it goes for our interests in fashion or cultural trends or virtually any other cultivation of interestsm, hobbies or political opinions with like minded others.
Due to this increasingly digital context of social life, and to the extent it is not privatized, these communicative exchanges and interaction patterns are retrievable and open to analysis with digital means. This opens up new social scientific and empirical possibilities, which a new field of digital methods seeks to exploit and appreciate. This new field of digital methods with its own strengths and problems has begun to take shape between the more traditional quantitative and qualitative conceptions of method.
This course provides a basic introduction to the field of digital research methods for undergraduate students. It requires no coding or programming skills or prior experience with digital research tools. It centers on hands-on exercises and mini-projects to explore the potential utility and versatility of a broad range of tools (e.g., for issue crawling and ‘mapping’, data scraping, text mining and visualizing data). The course teaches students to extract or ‘scrape’ text and interaction data from the Internet, including important social media platforms, and to visualise and analyse these data in novel ways and with novel means. The course will considerably augment the student’s range of means to access and analyse empirical material more generally: it is meant to generate competences which can be of use to complement and nuance virtually any social scientific investigation, eventually (or not) in tandem with traditional methods. The course also touches upon more theoretical aspects and discussions associated with digital social science, esp. digital sociology, and the use of digital methods, including theories about how (social) media frames and informs interaction, about the relationship between the digital and the social, and about the ethical implications and problems of digital research. Yet, it focuses on the development of technical skills and upon gaining familiarity with the software tools introduced during the course.

Enrolled students should prepare for unavoidable frustrations with the software tools used in the course. The fast changing reality of the Internet and the changing strategies of major web service providers, such as Google, and social media platforms like Facebook towards external researchers creates a number of difficulties.
 
All students need to commit to working in groups of 4 or 5 during the semester. If you are not prepared to engage in group work, this course is not for you. These groups will be formed by the instructors at the beginning of the course, and barring exceptional circumstances, they  will remain stable throughout the course. Importantly, students will take their final exam in these groups (see below).

",,,"
Course content
This course familiarizes social scientists with genetically informed social science research, with a special emphasis on sociological studies of social stratification. The course provides the relevant theoretical and empirical background for incorporating genetics into social science research and introduces the main methodological approaches. Throughout the course we use examples from stratification research and family demography to illustrate how the integration of genetic knowledge can help us better understand the forces shaping social phenomena. Conceptually, we move beyond the “nature vs nurture” debate and focus on the “gene-environment interplay” acknowledging that the influences of both genetics and environments depend on one another.
The course is organized around a set of questions, including but not limited to, why should social scientists care about genetics? How can the integration of genetics enhance our understanding of intergenerational transmission processes? To what extent, and how do social forces moderate the impact of genes? How can we assess the role of genes empirically? What are the challenges and the ethical concerns of genetically sensitive research?
This course is taught in English and intended for both Norwegian and international students.

Course content
This course provides a comprehensive presentation of key dimensions of social inequalities in contemporary societies in the early 21st century. We address core issues such as economic inequality, intergenerational social mobility, gender inequality in education and work, residential segregation and immigration and ethnic inequalities.
The aim of the course is three-fold:

First, we provide an understanding of how macro-level patterns of social inequalities in the Norwegian welfare state compare to other rich, developed countries.
Second, we present an overview of research on the factors that contribute to the emergence and persistence of inequalities in income, wealth, educational attainment, class and residential locations. In doing so, we focus on three core dimensions; social origins and social mobility, gender inequalities and ethnic and racial inequalities.
Third, we present the potential consequences of social inequalities along these dimensions, and discuss which policy interventions are effective in tackling various forms of social inequalities

The course will address these and related questions:

Why have socioeconomic inequalities in Western societies increased since the latter quarter of the 20th century?
Why, and to what extent do the parents you are born to affect your future life chances, and why does family background matter more in unequal societies?
How do inequalities, poverty and social mobility or immobility affect individuals and societies?
Why are so many immigrants unemployed, what obstacles do immigrants and children of immigrants face in the labor market, and how can we ensure equal access to employment and pay for different ethnic groups?
Why do men still earn higher wages than women despite the fact that women now complete more education than men in most developed countries?
How do specific policy measures reduce social inequalities at the different stages of individuals’ life courses?

Throughout, we focus on how societal institutions, such as the welfare state, educational system, and labor market regulations shape countries’ levels of inequality related to socioeconomic status, class, gender, and ethnicity.
Students will be required to read scientific studies covering a wide array of relevant topics and from different disciplines. The syllabus is at a relatively advanced level, but reading it does not require knowledge and understanding of advanced statistical methods beyond the MA level. The syllabus focuses on state-of-the-art literature reviews and recent high quality empirical studies, but also covers some foundational theoretical texts and non-academic reports. We emphasize how good empirical research designs can be used to answer important research questions, which will be useful for later work on your master thesis.
The course will provide you with knowledge and skills that are highly relevant for your employment opportunities, such as analytic skills and critical thinking, as well as insights into important topics such as socioeconomic inequalities according to family background, gender and ethnicity, employers’ hiring practices, welfare policy, the labor market, economic growth, human capital, and equality of opportunity.

Course content
This course will provide a sociological analysis of population health and health inequalities. The course surveys social determinants of health and links theoretical work (e.g. material, psychosocial, and fundamental cause theories) to empirical analyses of health, focusing on recent developments in the field such as exploring the role of genes, the links between political populism and health, new challenges related to the global pandemic and planetary health.
The course is structured around following five consecutive themes: I. rational – explaining background, the key topics and conceptualization of health and illness in sociology and social epidemiology; II. Theories – describing the key theoretical explanations of existing health inequalities: III. Ascription – considering inequalities in health based on the key ascriptive characteristics such as gender, genes, race, and ethnicity; IV. Politics – reviewing the role of political populism within countries and the effect of global organizations on health outcomes internationally; V. COVID-19 – understanding the implication of COVID-19 for health inequalities; and VI. Future – revisiting our approach of population health by shifting emphasis on global and planetary health rather health in individual countries.
The aim of the course is three-fold:

First, to explain to students a paradox on the persistence of health inequalities in modern welfare states, Norway being one of the unequal societies in Europe in terms of differences in health outcomes between advantaged and disadvantaged groups.
Second, to equip students with an awareness that health care systems account for only a part of variation in health outcomes and that social and sociological explanations of health are of primary importance to understand why in some societies’ health outcomes are better than in others.
Third, to present to students with cutting-edge theoretical and empirical insights on how and why health inequalities within societies exist, why they also intensify, in some instances, and which policy interventions, if any, are effective in tackling health inequalities within and across countries.

The course will address these and related questions:

How did an epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases change the patterns of health inequalities?
Which are most influential theories explaining social inequalities in health?
What are potential social determinants of health at the micro-level (e.g. socioeconomic status, health behaviours)?
How do meso-level institutions and organisations such as social networks and communities influence health?
How do macro-level environment, institutions, policies, and the mode of radicalized politics shape individuals’ health?
Is there enough evidence to claim that the association between socioeconomic status and health is causal?
How does health selection (i.e. healthier individuals achieving higher socioeconomic status) explain observed social gradient in health?
What are the driving forces behind health inequalities in non-communicable diseases (e.g. aging societies, deaths of despair)?
What are the implications of the COVID-19 for health inequalities in communicable diseases?
How do health-related social movement shape population health?

Throughout the course we will discuss one of the central questions in this area of research – how health and health inequalities should be measured. Another central area of the course will be ongoing debate between the school of social determinants of health vs. the school of health determinants of life chances. Socioeconomic status and health are associated, but there is no consensus about the causal direction of the association. We aim to make sense of conflicting findings and theories in a causal framework.
In recent decades, health inequality researchers have been primarily focusing on noncommunicable diseases that afflict the ageing and industrialized societies such as Norway, but with COVID-19 and decreasing life expectancies in some countries, this focus can be shifting again by more actively considering inequalities related to communicable diseases such as the SARS-CoV-2 unprecedented global spread of the virus. Health is a contentious issue in the public arena, with both government and non-government actors being heavily engaged. We will examine political populism and social movements which at present actively shape population health. Conversely, policymakers who had aimed to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in health usually struggle to achieve measurable success, which we will also discuss.

",,,"
Course content
The course encompasses three themes – culture, politics and collectivity – and seeks to carve out different relations between them. It gives an introduction to selected theories and empirical research areas belonging to the sociology of culture while centering on questions regarding politics and collectivity.
The course plan is divided in three clusters, each of which is meant to enter the matrix of culture, politics and participation from a different perspective.

The course investigates the very concept of culture and the different ways it has been theorized and defined. What is culture in the first place? Is it meaning, signs and symbols? Art or ""high"" culture? Forms of language and communication? Does it include the everyday? The body?
The course investigates political and emancipative potential in relation to subculture, in popular culture, in art and in our love lives and sexualities. How to understand the political in relation to youth subcultures? Has contemporary youth become depoliticized? Should a sociology of culture always be ""critical"" and ""political"" – and in which sense? Or is it only art – contrary to popular culture or ""cultural industrial"" forms – which carries an emancipative potential? Is the concept of taste political? How does new cultural tastes mirror (old) inequalities? Or is taste rather to be understood as a basic form of collectivity with the objects we treasure? What role does new social media play in political culture? How do they transform politics as we know it? How do they change our love life and our everyday interaction?
The course investigates the aspect of collectivity and participation as an important component in its own right. What does it really mean to have the feeling of participating in something? What is love? When did it come into being? How has it changed? What role does collective aspect play in cultural and political phenomena? What role does the affective and bodily play in our collective and political life? How to understand the relation between collectivity and politics?

Learning outcome
Course participants will acquire skills and competencies in order to design a fully mixed methods study and develop an appropriate strategy to answer specific research questions. In this regard, some little-known techniques (“inter-vey”, calendar interviewing, Delphi method, mystery shopper), classified as “merged methods”, will be demonstrated. They are particularly interesting because could represent an overpassing of the qualitative and quantitative divide, by the fact they embody in one single method the advantages of either approaches or methods. Finally, it will be argued how mixed methods are useful for decolonizing contemporary methodology and why they are particularly suitable for studying multicultural societies.
",,,"
Course content
From the 1990s Mixed Methods Research (the integration of “qualitative and quantitative approaches or methods in a single study or a program of inquiry”) is a well-known and established field but it also remains a hot topic in contemporary social science. However, it is not a novelty in the methodological landscape. It was practiced by Frédéric Le Play (1840s), Eilert Sundt (1850s), Charles Booth (1886), W. E. B. Du Bois (1897), B. Seebohm Rowntree (1899), Max Weber (1907), and the Chicago School (1920s).
After disappearing for forty years, mixed methods had their renaissance in the 1990s. However, their second wave is rooted in important experiences and practices of the past, without which the philosophy and epistemological foundations of contemporary mixed methods research cannot be fully understood.
The course will give an overview about current debates and the key issues in the field. Firstly, an alternative classification (of the main methodologies currently used in social sciences) will be proposed, aiming to overcome the outdated dichotomy qualitative-quantitative. Then, the conventional quantitative language of social research (shaped by terms such as 'measurement', 'hypothesis', ‘indicators’, ‘variable', ‘sampling’, ‘generalization’, ‘validitiy’ and so on) will be revisited in the light of a new epistemological framework, adding new meanings/concepts (to these positivistic terms) compatible also with qualitative approaches. Because the re-joining of qualitative and quantitative approaches in a new methodological ground (sometimes called a “third paradigm”) can be achieved only by merging some languages, procedures, codes and mindsets of these two paradigms, not simply mixing or juxtaposing methods. The main objective of mixed method research is to create a dialogue between different ways of seeing, interpreting, and knowing, not simply in combining different methods and types of data.

Course content
Gender relations and families come increasingly with various features and in various shapes. Contemporary transformations are connected to societal trends, such as individualization, migration, new technologies, new inequalities, and changing family policies. How are we to conceptualize recent and ongoing changes in gender relations, family structure and family life? Which mechanisms are at work when individuals and families adapt to new social circumstances? What are the implications for social justice and policy? This PhD course zooms in on new theoretical developments in the study of family and gender. Three lines of theorizing will be covered. First, classification and categorization of new family and gender regimes and of family policies. Second, explanatory models and theories of family change, with a particular focus on the role of gender and gender equality. Third, theories of social justice, with a particular focus on the relationship between family change and equal opportunities, and the role of family policy. The course will link theoretical discussions closely to methodological discussions and empirical findings. It will be a central aim for the course to connect research and theorizing in sociology to relevant research fronts in demography, political theory and policy studies.

Course content
This course is an introduction to economic anthropology. Taking the recent global financial crisis as a starting point, we explore how anthropological explanations of why and how people engage in different kinds of economic activities might offer alternative perspectives and explanations to those of mainstream political or economic analysis.
The course explores these themes through an investigation of classical economic anthropological issues, such as the distinction between gifts and commodities, the relationship between people and objects of exchange, such as money, and most crucially the issue of the moral basis of markets and other forms of economic activity.
Students are made aware of ethnographic variety, with emphasis on the interaction between production, trade, marketing and consumption in different regions. Emphasis is also placed on identifying links between local economic practices and understanding on the one hand, and global economic interconnections associated with for example.
Specific topics studied in this regard include:

Markets and social inequality
state management and creation of market economies
the morality of financial markets
understanding the extent and limits of terms such as ‘capitalism’ or ‘neoliberalism’ in understanding contemporary variations in economic life through the use of diverse ethnographic examples

This course gives an introduction into the ethnography of East and Southeast Asia, with an emphasis on both classical and contemporary research interests related to that region. By focusing on kinship, personhood, emotion, sexuality and gender, indigeneity, capitalism and urban change, we will explore, amongst other things, the following set of questions:

How is relatedness produced in this part of the world?
How does kinship get entangled with local memories of war (e.g. in Vietnam or Cambodia)?
How is wealth being made in East Asian nightclubs, where men come to network amongst themselves, while women engage in the sexual and emotional labor that allows these connections to arise?
What constitutes a person in Southeast Asia, and what can we learn about emotions by, for instance, studying small-scale highland groups in the Philippines?
How does being indigenous become tied into contemporary resource struggles in Southeast Asia?
How are fluid gender identities made sense of, and how does sexuality become tied into both nationalist and postcolonial projects across the two regions?
And finally, what can we learn about Asia’s changing position in an increasingly globalized world when we look at cases of capital and labour on the move in this dynamic region?

The course conveys knowledge about regional ethnography, and provides thereby a basis for comparative ethnography.
As the course proceeds, the students will first obtain an overview of anthropological research traditions related to the region, and of main questions and themes that have been developed from regional ethnography. Subsequently, the main part of the course will focus on recent and current subject matters that shape contemporary anthropological research on the region.

Course content
The European sphere is arguably the only continent in the world with undefined geographical boundaries. The areas in which it extends can easily stop at St Petersburg, or extend deep into the Caucasus, according to the historical and ideological imagination employed. This sociocultural building of what Europe is, brings to the fore some main components of social constructivism that are of great interest to the anthropological eye. What is more, “Europe” has been defined by centuries of colonialism, as outward imperialistic expansion brought an array of influences into the continent, while it exported violence and subjugation.
The course critically visits the identity and perception of “the European”, as well as the social and cultural life of Europe and the institution of the EU, which has become in recent decades a synecdoche of Europe at large. However, while the EU acts as a normative guardian and a benchmark of Europeanness, we shall explore the limits of the EU as Europe’s representative and the limitations of “EUrope” as a cultural construct. The course navigates the Mediterranean, a major sea of historical reference for European peoples, both of those in the South who share its shores and those in the North that have planned trade and cultural identity around it.
Moreover, the course deals with alterity is within and across Europe, an otherwise self-celebrated cohesive continent. Europe is aplenty with otherness, be it minorities, migrants, refugees, or even entire regions of “European people” who do not find a way into becoming fully accepted as Europeans by their peers. This selective Europeanness leaves out half of the continent in certain readings, and week four focuses on the peoples of the Balkans, Eastern Europe and Russia, as well as on the excluded immigrants to Europe.

Course content
Gender and kinship are key issues in anthropology, although the latter has traditionally carried much more weight than the former. 
Whereas kinship has to a certain extent framed the discipline of anthropology, gender studies first gained momentum in the 1970s, fomenting a critical perspective on the discipline as a whole, including kinship.
As analytical concepts, kinship and gender converge around the debates on natural differences, biological givens, and the ethnocentric bias of the use of these concepts in anthropology: that kinship and gender studies have been based on a western folk model of human reproduction and that the (sexual) difference between men and women have been seen as pre-social. 
Within contemporary anthropology, kinship and gender are viewed as mutually constitutive; one cannot be properly grasped without paying due attention to the other. Both kinship and gender are about relational practices, articulating different forms of relatedness. 
Moreover, there is a general recognition that not only are there cross-cultural variations in the way kinship and gender are perceived and practiced but that also within any one society there may be different elaborations of kinship and gender. This course will focus on the nature of such elaborations, both practices and processes, as these are productive of social inequalities and notions of difference more generally. Thus we will explore how kinship and gender practices inform social relations of:

equality
hierarchy
ambivalence
violence

Whereas the study of gender has increased its significance within complex, modern societies, the contrary, it appears, holds true for kinship. 
Among social scientists, there has been a tendency to assume that with modernity, kinship loses its organizing and explanatory force.   However, as this course will demonstrate, both kinship and gender are central to our understandings of contemporary societies.
One domain where kinship and gender intersect is reproduction, amply evident in practices of assisted conception.  Ideas and practices of kinship and gender are also vital to:

politics
economy
religion and Law
race
personhood
bodies

Drawing on a cross-cultural perspective, and with a view to critical reflection, the course aims to explore the kinds of contemporary phenomena that kinship and gender help to elucidate and how these two core modes of relatedness come together.

How peoples’ understanding of the environment can be related to identity.
How nature—animals, plants and landscapes—can become sites of contestation and conflict.
How the environment can be a meeting point between different knowledge traditions.
How current environmental changes can be understood as a complex and unpredictable outcome of several processes of humans-environment relations.
How both slow and sudden environmental crises may affect how we think about the future and what it means to be human.

Course content
How do people and communities around the world respond to, take part in, or resist fast changes affecting their lives?
In the 21st century – the era of electronic communication and global neoliberalism – change is, in many parts of the world, fast, volatile and unpredictable. While the anthropology of globalization and of transnationalism is well established, the anthropology of accelerated global change and connectedness is still incipient. This course aims to present these topics as well as to contribute to their development.
The anthropological literature on globalization has always emphasized the primacy of the local, the dual forces of homogenization and heterogenisation characterizing globalizing processes, and frictions between small-scale communities and large-scale projects. Concepts such as localization, hybridity, multi-sited fieldwork and the informal sector have shaped the field.
This course introduces some new conceptual and methodological tools enabling a deeper understanding of:

the connections between localities and global or transnational systems
connections between localities, facilitated by intensified communication networks, increased trade and mobility, and an increased awareness of the challenges facing humanity and the planet as a whole

The course aims to give an outline of a global, comparative anthropology attentive both to the uniqueness of the local and the characteristics of the global.

Course content
This course gives a basic introduction to Medical anthropology. Medical anthropology studies the universal human experience of health and illness, and attendant practices of medicine and treatment, across societies and cultures, in specific local situations, and under the impact of global political, economic and ideological forces.
It links anthropological domains, from kinship and religion to politics and economy, and has significantly shaped the development of the overall discipline in recent decades. It has its roots in classic anthropological themes, such as magic, possession, witchcraft, the afterlife, and personhood in so-called ‘non-Western’ societies. But, equally importantly, medical anthropology has revealed the local specificity of ‘universal’ biomedical practices and thinking, and has more recentlyturned to history and societal change, colonialism and its impact, political-economic transformations, and science and technology.
The course covers basic topics like illness, care and medicines, and specific themes, such as childbirth, mental health, toxic pollution, infrastructure, hospitals and epidemics.

Course content
First and foremost, the course provides an overview of themes and approaches to the digital, from social media to smartphones, from temporality to mobility. Secondly, it presents and discusses the methodologies required to study these phenomena, relating them to classic ethnographic methods. Thirdly and finally, the course contextualises the new digital technologies historically, indicating continuities and ruptures with enduring and classic themes and theories of anthropology. It therefore presupposes basic knowledge of anthropological theory, method and subject matter. Whether your passion is smartphone use in a society that interests you – rural Zambia, urban Brazil, highland Burma or the western suburbs of East London – or the implications of the Internet in a particular sector – health, education, business … – or if your interest rather lies in theories of networks, principles of social organisation or the fundamentals of communication, this course will add unexpected depth and relevant breadth to your knowledge of the contemporary world and the human condition.
The course covers a broad range of issues relating to digital technologies, including:

Social networks online and offline
New methodologies tailored to research on digital communication
The transformation of work
Empowerment and surveillance in digital capitalism
Games and gaming
Micro-coordination and the smartphone as locative media
Temporality, simultaneity and acceleration
Mobility and the smartphone
Information excess

In the lectures, these subjects will be dealt with on their own terms, but they are also connected to the non-digital, both historically and in a contemporary sense, thereby indicating historical continuities, perhaps even human universals, and not merely rapid change.

Critical perspectives on lay discourse and academic studies related to migration, diversity, and integration

",,,"
Course content
This course provides a theoretical and empirical introduction to contemporary migration and consequences of migration. Whereas migration always has characterized human societies, contemporary patterns of global migration are novel in their political, ethnic and religious significance for diversity and integration within and across nation-states. International human rights regimes counter regional and nation-state independence in struggles over asylum requirements, family reunion rules, welfare rights for migrants and their children, and integration policies. Discussions of migration, refugees and integration increasingly characterize public debate. Questions concerning migration and integration rate high in national as well as regional polls about important political issues.
This course will focus on understanding contemporary migration in a historical, theoretical, and comparative perspective, with a major empirical focus on Europe. Among the questions that will be raised and discussed are: Why does migration create such political turbulence? What are the reasons and driving forces behind contemporary migration? How does migration connect with diversity, national and global patterns of inequality, and integration? Do for instance the children of immigrants and ethnic minorities fare worse or better than natives in getting jobs, education and more informal social inclusion?
Theories of ethnicity, nationalism, transnationalism and racism will inform the discussion of how migration links with diversity and integration in the contemporary world.

",,,"
Course content
Migration, race and diversity are high on the agenda of political debate in Europe today. In this course, we take a closer look at how collective action and political protest have related to these themes in earlier times and today. Although most of the research texts in the course will deal with collective action motivated by structural positions and social identities related to ethnicity, religion, class, gender, nation and race, we are open to students who want to focus on other themes such as for example climate, feminism or anti-capitalism. 
How do actors identifying with queer, feminist, and national movements relate to an increasing diversity in terms of ethnicity, religion, and race? Do we see an increase in intersectional frames and mobilization efforts in feminist, nationalist and anti-racist movements? How have new movements and identities emerged as a result of greater global connectedness and increased attention to global inequalities and decolonization? And, how do ethnic, racial and religious minorities relate to transnational movements and political protest? Does political mobilization in the diaspora foremost relate to local or national interests in home countries, or to other identities and interests such as gender, sexuality, religion and anti-racism?
These, and similar questions, are central in this course, which uses sociological theory about social movements and empirical research on collective action and protest. The development of social movement theory over time, and different perspectives within the field, constitute the theoretical core in the course. The analytical focus, however, is on empirical research on anti-racist, religious, racial-ethnic and post-colonial protest and movements and on intersectionality within and between movements. We will focus specifically on identity dilemmas in the so-called identity movements and their changing character and constituencies since the 1960s. Both organized and more spontaneous forms of cultural and political contention and communication via different media will be covered in the course. 
Students will learn about democratization and political protest in a sociological perspective, based in the international social movement and mobilization literature.

Course content
Nuclear weapons pose an enduring challenge to international security and stability. In this class, students will examine the nuclear strategies of different nuclear weapons states, ranging from small states to the most powerful states in the international system.
Students will study basic theories about how nuclear weapons affect international conflict, and why nuclear weapons states adopt different strategies. Delving inside the state, we will examine how perception and bias affects how decision-makers seek to operationalize these strategies. 
This interactive class is organized around three thematic clusters:

the effect of nuclear weapons on international politics and conflict
nuclear strategy in theory and practice
strategic stability.

Students will use theoretical and empirical approaches, as well as simulations and applied analyses, in studying these issues. Students will be exposed to practitioner perspectives in analyzing how states seek to tackle the risks of a nuclear arms race in Europe. They will explore the dynamics of crisis escalation through a simulation exercise based on a nuclear crisis in northern Norway in 1995.

Important: This course is canceled due to the corona virus.
 
The overall purpose of this course is to focus on Norway’s national security interests especially in the High North in light of NATO’s evolving collective defense and collective security roles. The course and simulation exercise provide an opportunity for students with interests in international relations, international diplomacy, and comparative government to analyze and put into practice the diverse positions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states on a variety of complex and contentious challenges facing the alliance, including transatlantic relations and current military, political, security issues. The course addresses NATO’s relations to Norway, with particular focus on how NATO as an alliance shapes Norway ’s security and defense policy and vice versa, and how the specific challenges related to the Arctic region, Russia, and other states’ policy priorities, inform Norwegian responses and strategic visions. The course is organized in two main parts: The first main part involves lectures and readings on international relations and international diplomacy while emphasizing regional security and stability for Norway, Europe, and NATO including the evolving nature and character of NATO from American scholarly and policy perspectives. The second main part of the course includes a simulation exercise that would use NATO as a model to deliberate joint security issues through crisis simulation.  The simulation exercise is designed to help registered students learn how NATO members interact through diplomatic skills and negotiations in determining matters of collective defense and security. 
In discussing the challenges and dynamics of Norway’s alliance policy, the course focuses on three points: (1) what Norway does to manage its security challenges and status as a small state, both through procurement policies and multilateral security cooperation; (2) how Norway manages its relationship with its Arctic neighbor, Russia; and (3) to how Norway’s Arctic policy and High North Arctic strategy have performed as responses to the challenges that Norway and NATO face today.

Game theory may be defined as the use of formal models in the study of strategic interaction. This course offers an introduction to game theory and its potential applications to the study of war. Game theory suggests at least three main sources of war. First, war may result from asymmetric information. Because countries may have incentives to misrepresent their military strength, they may be unable to settle a dispute peacefully. Second, commitment problems might result in war. If two countries want to settle a dispute peacefully but suspects that the other side is unlikely to abide with the terms of that settlement, they may resort to warfare. Finally, war could result when the main source of the dispute involves an indivisible good, so that a compromise is difficult or even impossible.
The course will place particular emphasis on explaining puzzles related to war in general and World War I in particular. Specifically, the course provides a primer in core issues concerning war, including (but not limited to):

Information problems
Commitment problems
Indivisibilities
Arms races
Coalition building
War termination
Differences between international and civil wars

Course content
This course provides an introduction to the field of comparative politics, one of the major sub-disciplines of political science.
Comparative politics is the study of political phenomena that occur primarily within states and other political systems. It focuses on internal political structures, actors and processes, and analyze them empirically by describing, explaining and predicting their variety across systems – be they national, regional, local, or even supra-national. The course has three major goals: 1) to introduce you to the major theories and questions in comparative politics, 2) to present you with the empirical answers to these questions and 3) to give you tools to reflect critically on these answers. It focuses on the national level of politics and will present you with competing theories and evidence from recent original research. 
The course is organized thematically and covers the following topics:

The sub-discipline as such and its historical context
The concept and types of political regimes
Transitions between dictatorship and democracy
Political institutions in democratic political systems
Voters, parties and interest groups
Social movements and collective protest
Revolutions and civil war
Policy outputs and feedback

Examples of questions the course addresses are:

What is “democracy” and how do we measure it?
Why are some countries democratic whereas others are authoritarian?
How do governments form and how does their composition differ?
How do interest groups organize and try to exert political influence?
When do ordinary citizens turn to protest and political violence?
How do elections and resulting governments shape public policy?

The election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States in 2016 and his subsequent term in office has been one of the dominating issues in global news media in the last years. The policies of the Trump government not only had a significant impact on the United States but also on global politics. At the same time, his interaction with the press and the public especially through social media are a unique feature of his presidency. On November 3 2020, the citizens of the United States will go to the polls to elect a new president as well as new senators and members of the House of Representatives. Whether Donald Trump will get to govern for a second term, or if his democratic opponent will be able to enter the White House, and what either result might mean for US as well as global politics will be the core questions around which this course is centred. This course will accompany the build up to the election, the election night, and its aftermath by offering a lecture series with changing speakers from the Department of Political Science, other departments at the University of Oslo, and from outside the university. Besides the question, who will most likely succeed in the presidential election, the course will introduce students to the way in which the presidential elections in the US work, the other electoral races that take place in parallel (e.g. for members of Congress), how the election will shape US politics, what role media plays in the election, and what impact the election will have on different policy fields.

Politics, both domestically and internationally, raises a host of vital normative questions. How should resources, rights, political power, and burdens be distributed? How should we ideally respond to injustices committed by state and non-state actors? And which real-world constraints (should) shape our normative evaluations and prescriptions? This course focuses on recent developments within core issues of normative political theory. In particular, the course focuses on wealth distribution and taxation, access to natural resources, the politics of climate change, shifts in immigration patterns, the rights of minorities, the politics of warfare, the rise of non-majoritarian institutions, and the importance of globalization. In each case, the course employs normative political theory to examine these topics, assess their importance, and help prescribe potential remedies.

Who, if any, governs the world economy?
How powerful are democratically elected governments compared to multinational companies when capital, investments and production processes cut across national borders?
Do international institutions have a role in the governance of the global economy?
Are the trade relations between the US, the EU and China, pure conflict or is it actually a cooperative relationship?
Why are international investments increasingly important in the distribution of power and welfare?
What caused the financial crisis of 2008, and the following European economic crisis?
What are the long-term consequences of the crises?

These are examples of questions asked and answered in this course.
You will be given an introduction in key theories and perspectives on power, governance and processes of interaction among the key actors in the global economy. Special focus will be put on the role of international institutions. You will learn about the classical scholars in political economy, and modern perspectives on industrial organization, institutional economics, the financial system and trade theory.
The concept of globalization will frame the discussions. A key aim is to unravel the political processes and institutions that enforce, but also stem, the globalization of economic activities and discuss the national and international political consequences thereof, including the distribution of power and values. For this purpose, theoretical arguments will be illustrated with empirical examples from the international production-, finance-, and trade systems.

Course content
Violent conflict and the systematic (often violent) violation of human rights remain a pervasive feature of international politics. Yet the forms in which political violence occurs and the international responses to- and causes of it vary widely. What types of political violence exist, how do they interact with the international system, and what are their causes? Furthermore, what characterizes different international responses to these human rights violations? How effective are they? In this class, we address the different major types of political violence and human rights violations, their international dimensions, and international responses to it.
In the course, you will become familiar with the wide spectrum of different political violence and human rights violations that exist in international politics today. Examples include civil wars, interstate wars, repression, gender & violence, and colonial violence. You will learn about the causes and legacies of these human rights violations, and about the differences and similarities between them. In particular, we will discuss the international dimensions of these forms of violations and how they shape and are shaped by the international system and important actors in international politics. Finally, we will look into the measures that the international community has designed to counter these violations, such as the international human rights regime, the United Nations, and peacekeeping missions. We will discuss how these institutions work and how effective they are in responding to and reducing the prevalence of conflict in international relations.

What determines the political attitudes and values of modern citizens? Why do they support some parties rather than others in elections? Why do they vote at all – and why don’t they? Have satisfaction with democracy and political trust declined in recent decades? These are core questions in the study of political behaviour. In this course, you will learn about the political behaviour of citizens in Western democracies.
The course is organised around three major themes: values, voting, and trust. The first theme concerns citizens’ belief systems, notably their political attitudes and values: how are these structured, what explains them, how are they changing? The second theme concerns electoral behaviour: why do people vote (or not) at all, and if they do, how do they choose among the parties? Finally, the course covers generalized “political trust” in democratic institutions and processes. Is political trust on the decline, and if so where and why? What are the broader consequences of political trust for politics and society?
In all three parts, we emphasize the interplay between citizens and political parties: how do  these affect and react to each other? In each part, moreover, the course considers a variety of explanatory factors, including deep-seated explanations connected to social background (e.g. class, education, gender) as well as more short-term explanations (e.g. election campaigns, fluctuating economic interests, and the performance of the incumbent government).

The distinction between democracy and dictatorship (or “autocracy”) is one of the central ones in politics. Yet not all autocracies are alike—relatively open autocracies with elections and other seemingly democratic institutions, such as Singapore, exist alongside brutal and closed autocracies, such as North Korea. What distinguishes autocracies from democracies? And, what characterizes politics under different types of dictatorship? In this course, we address how autocratic regimes emerge, how politics plays out in such regimes once they are in place, and how autocracies die.
In the course, you will become familiar with a wide spectrum of autocratic regimes from across the world, with very different institutions. You will also become familiar with the key players shaping politics and their strategies. In particular, we will focus on how dictators and their support coalitions sometimes repress opposition and sometimes co-opt them and make them allies. We will further discuss how such strategies as well as different autocratic institutions shape not only policy, but also key outcomes such as economic development, income inequality, and war. Finally, we will look into which factors make some autocracies endure for decades, whereas others break down. In extension, we will discuss why the autocracies that do break down are sometimes replaced by new autocracies, whereas others are replaced by democracies.

Why do people waste their vote across the world? Why do ethnic groups kill each other in some places and not others? Why does the same policy seem great in one place and fail miserably in another? Many of the political events and developments taking place in the world may seem strange, politics can seem chaotic and unpredictable.
Comparative politics offers a rich tradition of empirical and theoretical insights that can help us make sense of the political world. In this course, we will look at puzzles from real-world politics and seek explanations for them in the comparative politics literature. The goal is to understand more about why things happen the way they do, but also when and why theories are useful, and how they may need to be modified to become more useful.
 
Our areas of focus are voting behavior, protests and violence, and the effects of institutions and policies. The course is about theory and theory development in comparative politics, but it also has a strong empirical component. Examples are taken from across the world, with a focus on developing democracies.

The end of communist rule in former Eastern Europe was widely seen as the culmination of the third wave of democratization. However, the ‘revolutions’ of 1989 were not uniform processes: the starting points were different, the trajectories were different, and so were the outcomes. Some countries never progressed beyond hybrid regimes, while others became liberal democracies and joined the European Union – and some of these are now backsliding on democracy. This course combines insights into specific cases (Ukraine, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia) with a comparative take on some key issues in contemporary Central and Eastern Europe. Some of the questions raised in this course are:  

How do support for democracy, satisfaction with democracy, and political trust vary across the region?
Why did some countries successfully complete the transition from communism to democracy, while others got stuck in a half-way house?
What is democratic backsliding in theory and practice, and how can it be reversed?
How do oligarchs and grand corruption affect politics and democracy in the post-communist region? What roles do Russia and the European Union play?
How does populism in general and radical right populism in particular play out in the region?

Course content
Political scientists often pose questions of the type “Does X have an effect on Y?” Key to finding an answer is the formulation of a counter-factual: “What would Y have looked like in the absence of X?” The most significant challenge we face when trying to answer such questions with empirical data is that pre-existing conditions may affect both the explanatory factors and the outcomes we are interested in. This course examines ways to overcome this challenge by carefully selecting an appropriate research design and a suitable statistical model. The course aims to provide a toolkit of quantitative techniques for students interested in studying social science with observational data.
The first part of the course centers on experimental and quasi-experimental research designs. We discuss how randomization reduces concerns about pre-existing conditions and help us estimate causal effects making fewer assumptions. We then turn to experimental designs and empirical approaches based on an as if random assumption, such as regression discontinuity designs.
The second part of the course focuses on statistical modeling, which is also crucial for successful causal inference. We start by introducing Bayesian inference and how it differs from frequentist inference. We then discuss how to fit and evaluate models in a Bayesian framework, and how to specify an appropriate model for different types of data.
Students will get hands-on practice by learning how to implement the various techniques and by replicating existing studies in R. Students will also learn how to present results in a manner that is understandable to a general audience, for example by using graphs and other visual tools.

Course content
In all parts of political science, scholars often use a game-theoretic model or some other rational choice framework to analyze their research questions and to develop empirically testable hypotheses about politics and policy making. Examples of political science topics being analyzed with this analytical tool include aspects of international cooperation, international and domestic conflict, democracy, institutional design (at all levels), voting, bureaucratic politics and more. This course aims to enable students to use a game-theoretic model or other rational choice framework in their own research.
The course consists of five main parts

The first part introduces the students to the relationship between institutions, rational choice theory, and political science in general
The second part deals with the construction, solving and evaluation of formal models
The third part explains how models can be confronted with empirical evidence in the form of case studies
The fourth part studies how formal models can be confronted with experimental evidence
The fifth part similarly explains how models can be confronted with empirical evidence in the form of large-n statistical analysis

Course content
This course introduces students to the science and practice of designing surveys. It covers key aspects of survey design, including definition of a population, sampling of respondents, design of survey questions, response alternatives, the overall survey structure, and research ethics. The course discusses both the design of new “primary” survey data as well as the use of already existing comparative, national, and local surveys. Finally, while this is not a course in statistical analysis, it emphasizes how one can plan ahead for such analysis.
An important development is the increasing use of “survey-embedded” experiments. Such experiments randomly assign different questions, alternatives, or information to different groups of respondents. Survey-embedded experiments have long been used for methodological purposes, such as gauging the impact of question wording. But now they are increasingly used to answer a variety of substantive questions about politics, policy, and democracy; examples range from the impact of political rhetoric to assessing public policy designs. By engaging with the literature on survey experiments students learn about survey design as well as about key issues of substantive interest to political scientists.
The course is practically oriented in that students learn to design their own surveys and survey experiments, while communicate with others about concrete examples. At the same time, much emphasis is put on learning and applying general insights from the large research field on how design decisions affect empirical results.
The course should be generally useful for most students given the increasing use of surveys and questionnaires in settings where political scientists make a living (the examples include public administration, journalism, non-governmental organisations, and political parties). Also, the course is of immediate relevance for students planning to design new, or use already existing, surveys in their master thesis.

",,,"
Course content
Why did so many people throughout history decide that political power should be exercised democratically? Is democracy actually the best form of government? If so, which type of democracy? For millennia, different strands of democratic theory have arisen, shaping how democracy emerges, survives, declines, and re-emerges within nation-states. In this course, we begin by looking at how democratic theory related to the appearance of nation-states and its project of maintaining political power. Then we turn to how different theories of democracy impacted nation-state democratization in the 20th Century, transpiring in widespread liberal democracy efforts. After we look at how current crises, such as globalization, polarization, and populism, are impacting democratic systems. Finally, we ask whether democratic theory can marshal responses to these (and other) problems, and if so, what those responses might look like.
Overall, in this course, we will:

Trace how the rise in political power of nation-states related to the rise of democratic thought.
Discuss how different theories led to waves of democratization over history.
Examine current problems facing democracies across the globe.
Question how, if at all, democratic theory might help us respond to myriad crises we are facing.

Course content
As the world becomes more interconnected, states increasingly find themselves in relationships of interdependence where the welfare of each depends on the actions of all. International negotiation constitutes an important tool to peacefully manage such relationships of interdependence and to prevent or end violent conflict. But when do actors engage in negotiations to resolve their disputes and under what conditions do they succeed?
Taking the point of view of the practitioner of negotiations, this course gives you knowledge about the negotiators’ rationale for different types of strategies and tactics, how different types of strategies and tactics may generate different types of negotiation dynamics and which implications different types of dynamics may have for the negotiation outcome. The course also gives you insight in the negotiation of nuclear disarmament agreements, peace agreements and their content, how emotions may affect negotiation behaviour and approaches to deal with post-conflict challenges.
Teaching includes lectures and seminars, meetings with practitioners of negotiations, and a mandatory one-day simulation exercise where students play the role of a negotiator.

",,,"
Course content
Since the industrial revolution, human imprints on ecological systems have increased substantially. This development generates major challenges for international environmental governance. In particular, effective governance of the global environment often requires international cooperation.
Since the middle of the 20th century, the number of international environmental agreements (IEAs) established to cope with this challenge has grown rapidly. This course considers the conditions under which IEAs may or will be effective in solving major international environmental problems. Particular attention will be given to climate change; however, the course will also consider other environmental problems, such as transnational air pollution.
The course will consider several scholarly debates, including the following:

whether IEAs are best based on norm building or on restructuring incentives;
whether IEAs are best developed top down or bottom up;
whether (full) participation in and compliance with IEAs require enforcement;
whether international environmental problems can be solved on the basis of unilateralism; and
whether transnational cooperation between subnational units (such as cities) can contribute significantly to solving global environmental problems.

This course studies Arctic change from the perspectives of geopolitics and governance. Geopolitics denotes the interplay of natural resources, geographic space and strategic dominance, whereas governance is about creating and operating institutions that structure the interaction of state and non-state actors in pursuance of individual as well as collective interests.
Climate change and the retraction of the polar ice are in the process of opening new and shorter sea routes between Asia and Europe or North America and might improve access to natural resources in the High North, like minerals, petroleum and some fish stocks. These and other developments may generate conflict but also strengthen incentives for cooperation. The course examines how Arctic change relates to processes and drivers at the global level, including recent developments in ocean law and politics and the rising prominence of Asian states in the world economy.
Among the issue areas studied are

sovereignty and military security

Course content
Changes this semester due to the Corona situation: The school part of the exam will be replaced by a home exam, the time and extent of the exam will be the same.
This course analyses the role of the EU and the major member states in foreign policy, broadly conceived. We examine the actors France, Germany, and the United Kingdom as well as the EU’s actors in general and in four case studies (security and defence policy, trade and development policy, migration and border control policy, and the US-EU relationship, using Iran as a case).
The main theme of the course is to study the role of Europe in international politics after Brexit with particular attention paid to the EU and its future as a foreign policy actor. Brexit amputates the EU and protests about a common migration policy from the Visegrad states implies that integration cannot continue like before. Yet much foreign policy power still resides in the EU Commission due to the changes made by the Lisbon treaty. Moreover, the EU now openly calls for ‘hard power’, trying to become an actor that can play a role in a realist political landscape.
We will examine the actual role of key member states and of EU actors in the four cases, asking whether Brexit means that the major states play an increasing role in general. Moreover, we will ask whether theories of EU studies are fruitful, especially integration theory.
Students will delve into in-depth study of recent foreign policy in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom as well as of the EU. We will pay attention to the changes wrought by Brexit and study recent policy cases. As students will write a term paper for the course they are encouraged to explore such cases, probing theories of foreign policy-making.

Course content
Ever since the Homo erectus tamed fire at least 600.000 years ago, energy has been vital for the whole range of human activity. It provided heating that increased resistance to changing climate conditions, contributed to settlements and building of human societies, increased meat consumption and calorie intake and was the basis for engineering tools and effective weaponry. With the industrial revolution, expansion of energy services was a major contributor to economic growth. Today, citizens in developed economies take ample access to affordable energy resources as granted.
Following a basic introduction to the role of energy in modern societies and today’s energy systems, this course provides an understanding of the global politics of energy, the key actors, the role of international energy institutions, and not least the interaction between energy politics and markets. The energy policies of all states are inextricably linked to concerns about energy security, the economics of energy markets and the environmental impact of energy use. Thus, the course is relevant for students interested in geopolitics, international institutions, international political economy. A particular focus will be put on the role of the vast oil resources in the Middle East and the Internal Energy Market of the European Union. Last, but not least, the course will address the crucial role of renewable energy in the global combat of climate change.

Course content

What are nations?
How are they formed?
What is the relationship between ethnicity and the state?

The course focuses on the phenomenon of nationalism and the expressions of ethnicity in the political sphere. It combines theoretical and empirical inputs from comparative political science as well as political sociology, but also draws on social anthropology, sociology and history to provide a comprehensive introduction into the issue.
It tries to strike a balance between teaching theories and anchoring them in empirical “selected issues” – contemporary manifestations of ethnic politics and influence of nationalist ideologies on political life.
The students will learn about the major theories of nationalism and the emergence of nations, which will then be applied to two empirical cases:

Norway
Central Europe (the Visegrád states)

The second half of the course discusses contemporary points of interest in which ethnicity and nationalism act both as conflict generators and potential tools of conflict resolution. Topics covered include:

modern nationalist political parties
ethnic minorities, with an emphasis on Eastern Europe
immigration, with a focus on Western Europe

Course content
The welfare state was a European invention that took shape gradually during the twentieth century. It consists of several policy domains, for example social insurances/cash benefits such as pensions, unemployment benefits, sickpay, parental leave, and social assistance. It also consists of public services like health care, elder care, child care, and so on. It is no exaggeration to say that the welfare state fundamentally restructured Western societies. Roughly half of state expenditures, and up to around a third of GDP, in advanced industrial democracies now concern the welfare state. This makes it a crucial subject matter for social science in general and political science in particular.
This course asks three groups of questions.

One has to do with the politics of the welfare state. What were the political-historical origins of the welfare state? How do voters, parties, and governments relate to various policy areas today? Are patterns of conflict and levels of support changing?
A second group of questions zooms in on policies themselves. What are the main policy dimensions and how do these vary across countries? Is there still a “Nordic model”? And how do welfare states now respond in the face of current challenges, such as population ageing, economic globalization, European integration, and immigration?
The third set of questions has to do with policy feedback. Can welfare state policies, once established, affect the “input side” of democratic politics? For example, do such policies somehow reshape citizens’ participation patterns, policy attitudes, or trust in democratic institutions?

The course should be of general interest to political science students and similar, for example to those with a specialization in comparative politics or in public policy.

Course content
This master course within comparative politics deals with two main types of organized political actors in democracies:

political parties
interest groups

We examine and compare their organizational structures, strategies, behavior as well as their political impact. Particular emphasis will be on the issue of political influence in public decision-making and how parties and interest groups shape the nature of democratic governance.

How do political parties seek political power?
Do parties matter for media’s agenda-setting and public policy?
How do interest groups lobby?
Are they able to exert influence?
What explain lobbying success of interest groups?
Does money talk in politics?

Attention is also paid to the (power) relationship between political parties and interest groups and how this has developed over time.
An overarching topic is what explains variation across political systems and time periods.
Different theoretical approaches and major empirical studies within these fields of research will be presented. We concentrate on politics at the national level in established democracies, but also address the role of organized political actors within the European Union (EU).

Course content
Until recently, a central tenet of political science held that once a country reaches a certain level of political and economic development, democracy will remain strong indefinitely. Yet, contemporary developments in democracies across the globe have challenged this “consolidation thesis”. During the recent decade, many countries seem to have experienced sudden or gradual deteriorations in democracy – so-called democratic erosions, and this includes fairly well established democracies such as Hungary, Poland, Brazil and the United States.
The aim of this course is to understand how and to what extent modern democracies are under threat, and to explore different drivers of democratic erosion. To do so, the course will draw on insights from across various strands of political science – including political behavior, comparative politics, political economy and political psychology. Our focus will be on micro-level processes that drive democratic erosion – including the behavior and choices of key actors such as leaders, political parties and the opposition, and the behavior and preferences of ordinary citizens. Yet, we will also consider how structural forces, such as economic inequality, education and demographic change, feed into these processes.
One recurring theme throughout the course is the question of how we best can draw inferences about the symptoms and causes of democratic erosion. We will critically evaluate and compare evidence from different state-of-the art methodological approaches,  such as survey- and lab-experiments, expert-coded data, cross-country time-series analysis, and case studies, discussing when each of these approaches are most suitable, and how they can complement each other.

Course content
Virtually every democracy in the world has a different electoral system. The rules of the electoral game determine who can run for office and vote, and how votes are translated into seats. This affects the party system that is formed, the types of identities that become politicized, and also the characteristics of the individuals who get elected. In recent years there has been an increasing focus on ensuring the inclusion of women and minority groups in politics. But how can we best design electoral systems to be inclusive, fair, and well-functioning? And what are the effects of changing representative institutions in various way?
In this course we will discuss questions about how electoral systems are designed, with a focus on issues related to the inclusion of women and minorities in politics. We will talk about the incentive structures that are created by differing electoral systems, how they may affect which identities end up being politicized, talk about what constitutes “women’s interests” or “group interests”, and look at the effects of changing who is in power. We will read scholarly debates, but also look at many empirical examples from across the world.

Course content
Environmental problems are reaching such large scale that they are affecting human wellbeing and threatening the very human survival. In order to fix environmental problems, individual action is insufficient and we need political interventions. Understanding which governments succeed in securing environmental protection can help us design policy interventions necessary to tackle environmental problems. In this course, we will discuss why countries respond to environmental problems differently. First, we will talk about the nature of environmental problems and challenges associated with commitments to solve environmental problems. Second, we will discuss collective action theory and how to use it to analyze current small- and large-scale environmental problems. We will delve into the role of the state in tackling collective action problems and cover the basics of environmental policy-making. Third, we will talk about different political institutions and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in addressing environmental problems. Among these institutions, we will discuss regime type, comparing democratic and authoritarian responses to environmental problems, bureaucratic quality, corruption, rule of law, and state-society relations. Fourth, we will analyze the role of public support in environmental policy-making and drivers of public support, including individual and external factors.

inter- and transnationally
within the EU
in domestic policy development
at the local level

Analytical tools and frameworks will be presented that can enable us to better understand and explain how the three issue areas have evolved over time, and why we see differences across countries and levels of governance.
Particular attention will be given to climate governance at multiple levels. We will explore how the climate policies of Norway and a group of other countries have evolved over time.
Throughout the course we will give special attention to how business and industry influence policy developments and what elected politicians can do to steer decision-making and implementation.

Course content
Education and research policies are very important for modern societies, because institutions such as kindergartens, schools and universities are supposed to educate people to become good citizens, prepare them for the labour market, or find answers to societal challenges like climate change. However, education and research policies show a large variance in many countries and the politics, meaning the political dynamics that shape these policies, play out differently depending on the context. This opens up interesting questions like:

Why do pupils in some countries go through a unified secondary school system, while in others they are separated based on their grades?
Why do you have to pay high tuition fees in some countries, while others are tuition free?
Why do some countries provide extensive student support and others do not?
What is the impact of these differences for educational trajectories or societal inequality?

All these questions and many others will be in the focus of this course on the politics of education and research policies. The course will not only introduce students to the differences between education and research systems in different (mainly OECD) countries, but also analyse and discuss factors that can explain the variation such as path-dependence of national education systems, party politics, Europeanization, or international reform trends that are promoted by organizations like the World Bank or the OECD

What is terrorism? Who becomes a terrorist and why? Where, when, and how is terrorism most likely to occur? These are some of the questions students will be able to provide answers to having completed this course. Terrorism has become one of the most salient and contentious issues in contemporary Western politics. The aim of the course is to give a general introduction to the field, and in doing so, enable students to work with terrorism-related topics within government agencies, non-governmental organizations, academia, or the security sector.
Rather than looking at terrorism globally, we will focus on terrorism and political violence in the context of Western liberal democracies. One reason for doing so is that explanations of terrorism and political violence vary considerably across regime types and regions. By incorporating the broader category of political violence, we will also be looking at violent militants who do not necessarily qualify as terrorists, but may still pose a challenge to Western democracies.
During the course, students will obtain more in-depth knowledge about selected topics. These include radicalization and recruitment to terrorist groups, theories on the causes of terrorism, terrorist group dynamics, and counter-terrorism challenges. Finally, the course will look into the particularities of specific actor types, including jihadists, left- and right-wing militants, and lone actors.

Course content
Historically, most political systems have been some form of autocracy, and even today a large (and increasing) share of the world’s population live in autocratic systems. Despite the importance of understanding how autocracies such as China or Russia work, political scientists have overwhelmingly focused on politics in democratic systems. Yet, over the last two decades, research on autocratic politics has developed rapidly, providing us with a wealth of data, empirical studies, and fascinating theories of the behavior of dictators and their supporters and opponents. This course will address key topics in this burgeoning area of research.
More specifically, the course is structured around six topics in autocratic politics, spanning different subfields of political science. The first three topics introduce you to the core building blocks of autocratic politics research. We will discuss I) how to conceptualize and measure different types of autocracies and who the key players are in these systems; II) how autocracies emerge and break down; III) practical and ethical considerations concerning how to do research on and in autocracies. The three final topics are more focused, with active researchers focusing on topics on which they have particular expertise. Examples of such topics are bureaucracies and violence; autocratic elections; information control and autocracies in the digital age.

University of Oslo,UIO,Social Sciences,Case Study Research Methods,7,,,[],,"
Learning outcome
The students will acquire:

Knowledge of the main current case study methods in social science, including their critiques and justifications.
An ability to apply different designs for single and comparative case studies in their own research.
An understanding of how case studies may be combined with other methods, such as statistics and/or formal modeling.

",,,"
Course content
The central goal of the course is to enable students to create and critique methodologically sophisticated case study research designs in the social sciences. To do so, the course will explore the techniques, uses, strengths, and limitations of case study methods, while emphasizing the relationships among these methods, alternative methods, and contemporary debates in the philosophy of science. The research examples used to illustrate methodological issues will be drawn primarily from international relations and comparative politics. The methodological content of the course is also applicable, however, to the study of history, sociology, education, business, economics, and other social and behavioral sciences.
The course will begin with a focus on the philosophy of science, theory construction, theory testing, causality, and causal inference. With this epistemological grounding, the course will then explore the core issues in case study research design, including methods of structured and focused comparisons of cases, typological theory, case selection, process tracing, and the use of counterfactual analysis. Next, the course will look at the epistemological assumptions, comparative strengths and weaknesses, and proper domain of case study methods and alternative methods, particularly statistical methods and formal modeling, and address ways of combining these methods in a single research project. The course then examines field research techniques, including archival research and interviews.

Course content
NB! Information will be updated by June 15th
The central aim of normative political theory is to reach justified conclusions on what is morally right and wrong in the political sphere. This encompasses both broad questions about how (domestic and international) society should be organized, including the conditions of legitimacy of political institutions, and moral dimensions of more specific political issues, such as questions related to war, or distributions of social and economic goods.
In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the methodological challenges of political theory, including challenges involved in making political theory relevant in practice: What is the relationship between political theory and political practice? How can one decide what political practices are morally right? What is the proper role or feasibility considerations in normative political theory? And of democracy? This course will give an advanced introduction to some of the most important contemporary debates. In particular, the course will cover:

The use of reflective equilibrium in normative reasoning, and methodological challenges involved in the use of cases and intuitions.
Ideal and non-ideal theory, and the debates about feasibility in political theory
The relation between facts and normative principles
The relation between methods in political theory and in other disciplines
Public reason
The relevance of democracy for the methodology of political theory
The relationship between theory and practice

The course is designed for PhD candidates who already have MA-level training in research methods, and we expect participants to come prepared to discuss the specific challenges of case selection, sampling and measurement in their own research projects as well as those of their colleagues. It complements other qualitative classes (e.g. focusing on case study methods, discourse analysis,or interviews) by focusing on practical application of qualitative methods in the field, as well as on the logistical and ethical challenges associated with fieldwork.
",,"
Learning outcome
This course will enable participants to:

critically assess the purpose and role of qualitative methods in their research design
broaden their repertoire of qualitative field methods
collect and process different kinds of data in the field: verbal, written, visual
integrate qualitative data with other data in their analyses
discuss methodological and ethical challenges associated with data collected during fieldwork 

",,,"
Course content
This course explores the design and application of qualitative methods to prepare doctoral students to select and use such methods in the field. The course is suitable for doctoral students interested in qualitative field methods as a central or complementary component of their research, and for reflecting more broadly on the benefits and limitations of such empirical work. It will be of particular interest to students considering fieldwork – broadly conceived – as part of their doctoral research. 
Topics covered include: descriptive and causal inferences based on qualitative data; preparing for fieldwork; selecting cases, sites, sources and respondents; archival work and text as data; interviews and participant observation; operationalization and measurement based on qualitative data; writing up your fieldwork materials; typical ethical and practical challenges.
It is preferable if participants are at a sufficiently early stage in their projects that substantial changes to their research designs are still feasible.

University of Oslo,UIO,Social Sciences,SCANCOR- Studying organizational change,10,,,[],,"
Learning outcome

Knowledge of the main ontological/epistemological approaches to studying organizational change (variance versus process perspectives), and how to apply them in practical, empirical studies of change
Ability to specify and operationalize the main elements of the content and context of change (variance perspective)
An understanding of studying change as a process, with a focus on the dynamic interplay between actors, events and time
Be acquainted with the discussion on the role of agency in organizational change and how it relates to leadership of change

",,,"
Course content
Understanding organizational change has been one of the main topics in organization theory from the classical writings of Max Weber, Chester Barnard and Philip Selznick to current theoretical streams like neo-institutionalism, strategic management, population ecology and organization design. The focus of this course is on empirical studies of organizational change, outlining different perspectives on how to conceptualize it, how to measure it, as well as different empirical strategies based in different ontological and epistemological positions.  This course aims to provide frameworks for the empirical study of organizational change, emphasizing how different perspectives on change will have consequences for empirical strategies for studying change. The students will be introduced to empirical studies of organizational change from disciplines as diverse as political science, management, psychology, and educational sciences.
The course will be structured around the following topics or themes:

Conceptualizing organizational change, including an ontological and epistemological discussion of organizations as fixed objects or fluid processes. This part will introduce the students to a generic model used to identify the main elements in studying change: driving forces, content (structure and culture), process, and context.
Operationalizing the content of change: formal structure (including strategies and policies, vertical and horizontal specialization, incentives, and written rules and routines), organizational culture (with a focus on attitudes, values and norms as well as artefacts), and behavior (at individual, group and organization level).
Discussing the role of context on change, both internal contextual elements (type of organization, size, etc.) and external (technical and institutional environments). This will also entail a discussion of the transferability of studies of organizational change from one context to another.
Specifying the process of change with a special focus on the role of both chronological and subjective time, series of events, and path dependency/historical dependence
The role of agency in organizational change. Alternatives to the dominant teleological logic; change as evolution, life cycles, dialectics, and change as garbage can processes. This part will also take up the discussion on how to study the leadership of change.
Different empirical strategies to study change with a main focus on variance versus process studies. This part will also contain a discussion on the appropriate level of analysis, how to link different levels of analysis, and on the measurement of the effects of change – both intended and unintended.

Course content
This course is also available as a 3 ECTS credits course.
Democratic innovation is high on the agenda in many Western liberal democracies. We see a mushrooming of initiatives aiming to stimulate policy innovation by rethinking the institutional set-up for representative democracy. This trend is particularly manifest at the level of local government. Many of the current institutional innovations aim to create closer dialogue between politicians and citizens. One of the key drivers behind this development appears to be that Western governments increasingly see citizen involvement as a precondition for solving many of today’s complex policy problems. Moreover, we are witnessing a change in political culture. Today’s citizens are anti-authoritarian, critical and competent, demanding more influence than the ballot box gives them.
As a part of the democratic innovations, elected representatives may have to take on a role as political leaders who exercise leadership in closer interaction with citizens and stakeholders. In the process of institutionalizing new initiatives for citizen inclusion in local government decision making, traditional institutions of representative democracy need to link to arenas where citizens and politicians can engage with each other. This need for linking representative and participatory democracy raises several, both normative and empirical, questions. Democratic innovation at the level of local government and beyond will have consequences for elected representatives, citizens and the way that democratic functions are performed. Discussing these consequences is at the core of this Ph.D. course.

",,,"
Course content
The core objective of this course is to address differentiation as a central concern in European studies, across academic disciplines from political science, public policy and public administration, to law, sociology and history. All modern political systems are differentiated; the EU is distinctly so. Precisely how and what the implications are for the EU and its member states remain contested. The course aims to conceptualize differentiation, discuss causes and effects of differentiation, and show how differentiation manifests itself internally in the EU and in the EU’s relations with non-members.
Through a combination of lectures by leading scholars and group work, the PhD course will introduce doctoral students to theories and observations on core aspects of differentiation. Training will draw resources from a large network of scholars with whom ARENA researchers collaborate. Students will gain access to state-of-the-art research and obtain knowledge on the type of critical theory of political differentiation that enables separating constructive from pathological forms of differentiation.
The PhD course, A differentiated Europe and its implications, will build upon a large collaborative network of scholars established as part of the EU-funded ARENA-coordinated project ‘EU Differentiation, Dominance and Democracy’ (EU3D) (2019-2023), and the broader network of its sister projects InDivEU and EUIDEA, which come together in the EU-funded Collaboration and Support Action DiCE (2020-2022).
For those participating from Oslo, the PhD course will be an excellent opportunity to discover Oslo. The welcome event on day one will include a trip to the Munch Museum and a subsequent dinner in the centre of Oslo. Lunch for in-person participants will also be covered.

Theme
There is no doubt that the EU has become more differentiated. With 27 member states the EU’s ethnic, linguistic, cultural, institutional and structural diversity is pronounced, and it is in direct contact with a more multifaceted and diverse neighbourly environment, which increases the likelihood that the EU imports diversity. A further source of differentiation stems from increased contestation. For those starting to take EU integration as a natural given, the Eurozone crisis and Brexit came as rude awakenings. The rise of Euroscepticism and Europhobic right-wing populism has given added impetus to a change from the ‘permissive consensus’ of the past to today’s ‘constraining dissensus’.
The PhD course is structured around the following four key topics:

Conceptualizing and theorizing differentiation: What are the key characteristics of differentiation? What are the various forms of differentiation? What is the relationship between differentiation and democracy? It is recognized that some forms of differentiation are conducive to democracy, while others might be pathological. We understand these under the heading of dominance, as arbitrary and unjustified forms of rule.
EU and differentiation: Overview of the current situation of differentiation in the EU context, with a focus on internal and external forms of differentiation.
The corona pandemic and EU differentiation: Discussing the corona pandemic’s implications for the EU: Will it lead to increased fragmentation and differentiation, towards increased integration and consolidation, or to incremental and path-dependent processes of pragmatic change.
Implications for Norway and the UK: Comparing the role and status of one ex-member and one closely associated non-member. What kinds of EU affiliations will these states have when the UK actually departs from the EU post-2020? How to locate these affiliations in the differentiation scheme that the course develops?

",,,"
Course content
Philosophical questions underpin all research whether explicitly acknowledged or not. Within the social sciences, important differences exist between, for example, how social processes are conceptualised, how to isolate causality (epistemology), and what methods produce valid data (methodology). At core, they reflect underlying assumptions (ontologies) about how society works, some of which are in direct contradiction with each other. These differences have important implications for the way that evidence is gathered and validated. As a result, it is important to grasp these differences and to be able to recognise how they influence the research process.
The course:

is aimed at providing students with a working knowledge of current philosophical debates and to help them understand the core concerns of all the disciplines in the social sciences.
links philosophical underpinnings to the different types of empirical analysis that are used.
discusses the challenges associated with identifying causal relationships in data on human interactions.

The goal is to strengthen students’ skills in using different theoretical frameworks in their own work, and to enhance their abilities to work across disciplines.

Learning outcome
Through this course the students will acquire sophisticated analytical skills and tools that will improve the abilities to study innovation and to navigate in processes of innovation. The students will be able to analyse, understand and explain some of the most important issues and driving forces in today’s societies. The course will provide the students with advanced knowledge on:

How to understand and analyse pressing societal phenomenons such as the green shift, digitization and the sharing economy
The dynamics of modern knowledge-based economies and societies
How organisations can become more innovative / Innovation management
How technology is developed and implemented in society
Commercialisation of science-based knowledge
The phenomenon of innovation and how it is often integral to societal change
The differences in growth and dynamics between sectors, countries and regions
The dynamics of socio-technical transitions
The systemic and evolutionary underpinnings of innovation – including how innovation is often conditioned by place specific institutions, infrastructures and practices
The role of public knowledge institutions and infrastructures, like universities, in innovation processes and systems

",,,"
Course content
Science and innovation are called upon to solve some of the most pressing problems of the world today, such as climate change, economic development and global health. But why does economic growth differ so much in the first place? Why do current climate change solutions to such a high degree emphasise development of new technologies? Can university-based research solve health problems in developing countries? If innovation is one of the big buzzwords of our time, why does it still seem to be so many barriers to it in organisations?
The main goal of this course is to increase the students’ knowledge of important concepts, issues, theories and dilemmas in innovation, building on introductory courses in innovation studies at the University of Oslo and elsewhere in the ESST partner institutions. Through examples related to climate change, digitalization, economic growth and public sector innovation, the topic of innovation is tied to some of the most important issues of our time. At the end, the students should be able to participate in high-level discussions about contemporary innovation theory, policy and management. From the lecturer side, the goal is also to create a good learning environment with interesting tasks and discussions – and to have fun while doing so!
Teaching is more closely related to the actual research carried out by the TIK personnel and guest lecturers. The modules should provide concepts and frameworks that can be used in students’ master theses, and the essay at the end of the course will be closely related to this as well. In addition, there will be practical group works in the course. This will mainly be self-supervised, although there may be special lectures and other types of input and feedback. Lecturers will be available for questions and we will try to adjust the feedback to the needs in the various groups. The course is organised into four modules each lasting two to three weeks. There will be a unique group work in each module, and which will have various formats.
The course will be organized into the following four modules:

Responsible research and innovation & the impact agenda
Digitalization and the sharing economy
Sustainability transitions: From fossil to renewable energies
Preserving the welfare state: Innovation in the public sector

In each of these modules the students will be exposed to analyses and tools to understand the dynamics of innovation and governance of innovation at both organisational and systems level.

Introduction course to STS.
This core PhD course provides an advanced introduction to Science & Technology Studies (STS) as a research area and an inter-discipline. It will cover selected classic theoretical-methodological approaches, such as social construction of technology (SCOT), actor network theory (ANT) and material semiotics as well as feminist science studies. The course will also introduce selected recent developments within the field of STS, including valuation studies, STS and the study of politics, life science studies, digital STS, infrastructure studies, and postcolonial STS. Mainly designed for PhD candidates whose previous background did not include STS, it combines an overview of selected foundational texts of STS with insights into current debates within STS. Participants will also be introduced to ongoing STS research projects at the TIK centre.
The course will consist of lectures and paper discussions, as well as a site visit and writing exercise. The site visit in the Oslo region is chosen in connection with ongoing research projects at TIK. We will probe some practical strategies of documenting the site visit and writing up observations. All participants will take active part in giving and receiving feedback on each other’s work.

Course content
Summary
The course provides a theoretical introduction and practical intervention into the inventive nature of ethnography. It can be contextualised in the growing dissatisfaction with the methods of social sciences and their incapability to address some of the problems of the contemporary. The course will animate the field creativity of students and invite them to experiment with inventive field devices in hands-on sessions and write about their experience to contribute the xcol inventory.
Detailed description of the course content
This course offers a theoretical introduction and practical intervention into the inventive nature of ethnography. The course takes as its starting point the idea that ethnographic fieldwork is founded upon relational invention: ethnographers always invent how to device the conditions to inquire with others. Departing from the conceptualization, this course seeks to (i) animate the field creativity of ethnographers planning or already undertaking their doctoral work, and (ii) offer theoretical arguments to justify their inventive practices. For this, the course includes theoretical seminars, debate sessions and hands-on ethnographic interventions to be carried out by participants. The course will invite students to experiment with inventive field devices and write about their experience (during the course or drawing on their own fieldwork) to contribute the xcol inventory (https://xcol.org/).
This course can be contextualised in a growing dissatisfaction with the methods of social sciences and their incapability to address some of the problems of the contemporary. As seasoned anthropologist Paul Rabinow stated two decades ago (before embarking in diverse collaborative and experimental ethnographies), our methods are fundamentally deficient. Under these circumstances we have seen in recent years how different scholars have ventured into exploring a wide variety of modes of ethnographic collaboration and experimentation. An aspiration that resonates to the proposal that Celia Lury and Nina Wakeford made ten years ago to foster “inventive methods.” The booming recent debate and explorations on multimodal anthropologies are, perhaps, a good index of this state of affairs: With those invoking the need to explore multimodality in anthropology and other social sciences through diverse forms of public engagement and experimentation, collaboration and diverse sensorialities (beyond sight) in our ethnographic inquiries.
The course offers a theoretical introduction that dialogues with the contributions of anthropologists like Roy Wagner, Marilyn Strathern and Paul Rabinow, the critique of research methods developed from the STS by authors like John Law and Evelyn Ruppert, and the invocation of the need to inject an inventive gesture in our empirical investigations proposed by Celia Lury, Nina Wakeford and Les Back, among others.
Besides, this course presents an ongoing work on the creative nature and inventive condition of ethnography currently undertaken at xcol, an ethnographic inventory: An open-source anthropological infrastructure dedicated, curated by the course organisers, taking inventory of the endless invention that is integral to any ethnographic inquiry. Xcol promotes a scholarly program that seeks to (i) document (or, in our parlance: take inventory) the diverse inventive activities of ethnographers, and (ii) animate the creativity of fellow ethnographers in their empirical engagements. This program grows out of our ethnographic experiences over the years and of many other ethnographers and anthropologists whose ethnographic relations are traversed by creative interventions.
Following suit of these scholarly engagements, the course includes both theoretical and debate sessions as well as practical exercises (all to be happening in a hybrid format, both in presence and with online parts). The first part of the course (face-to-face) will introduce a number of inventive devices that have been developed by different fellow anthropologists and ethnographers. This includes the use of fieldpoetry as a form of registry and engagement in the field, walking interviews as way to script encounters, gameboards as speculative devices and drawing as an ethnographic mode of inquiry. The inventory does not seek to be exhaustive; its goal is to present different modes of arranging the material and spatial dispositions of the ethnographic encounter. The second part of the course (online) will invite participants to engage in creative practices in field situations. During a three-week period, they will experiment with some field devices and will devise their own inventive engagements with the empirical. Participants will have three online meetings (1,5 hours long) during this time. As a result of these explorations, participants will be encouraged to contribute to explore how to describe or take inventory of their ethnographic engagements.

Course content
Documents are everywhere. Whether physical or digital, large or small, loud or invisible, they permeate our societies and individual lives, past and present. Some documents are outright celebrities, such as the UN Assessment Reports on Climate Change; others, such as passports, can open doors and borders – or keep them shut if yours is not accepted. Indeed, documents quickly pile up as empirical materials in our own research projects. So how to make use of this rich resource? How to analyze documents as part of your PhD project?
This PhD course brings together a varied set of methodological approaches to demonstrate and discuss how we can analyze documents as both text, artifact and social practice. Building on a recently published textbook, the course introduces the method of ‘practice-oriented document analysis’ (Asdal & Reinertsen, SAGE Publishing, 2022).
During the course, we will work on the methodological moves developed in this book for analyzing and working with documents: How documents can be approached as sites, how they can be analyzed as tools, how we can examine ‘document work’ and ‘document texts’, how documents are involved in the making of societal issues, and what we can learn from analyzing how documents move. We will draw from a rich source of document studies in STS and across the humanities and social sciences more broadly, and also introduce you to the theoretical underpinnings that have inspired our practice-orientation to documents.

The participants will first be presented with the positive bias in innovation studies, and then discuss relevant illustrations and analyses of the dark sides of innovation. The participants will also reflect upon theories and methodologies that can be used to assess together positive and negative impacts, economic and non-economic, within a common framework. Finally, the participants will also be encouraged to reflect upon the implications and challenges for research and innovation policy.
The course will be designed as a combination of online lectures and group discussions. The course will be structured around online academic presentations of some core themes provided by international guest scholars with specific expertise on innovation and welfare (Barry Bozeman, Ron Boschma, Fulvio Castellacci, Davide Consoli, Elisa Giuliani, Magnus Gulbrandsen, Simona Iammarino, Maria Savona).
The participants will also be asked to identify, analyze and present to the other participants a few selected cases and concrete examples of dark sides of innovation. Overall, the intention is that the course will foster PhD students’ ability to critically assess multiple impacts of innovation, and use these critical insights in their own PhD work.
",,,"
Course content
The field of innovation studies is based on the implicit assumption that innovation is good for the economy, and that more innovations will lead to a wealthier and more sustainable economy and society. Since the 1980s, the underlying idea that has motivated the field is that innovation leads to positive economic effects, such as economic growth and employment creation, and does for this reason foster individuals’ welfare by leading to greater wealth (Martin, 2016). Innovation research has in fact almost exclusively focused on the positive economic effects of new technologies, and how these contribute to solve grand societal challenges, e.g. by spurring firms’ productivity, industries’ international competitiveness and sustainability transition, and the dynamics and performance of national systems. Relatedly, this research has also represented the foundation for R&D and innovation policies, whose underlying rationale has so far predominantly been to foster the creation and diffusion of innovations (Edler & Fagerberg, 2017). More recent approaches, such as systemic and third generation mission-oriented innovation policy, are also implicitly based on the belief that innovations have the ability to address and solve grand societal challenges.
In spite of the importance and large consensus around the important positive effects of innovation, it is also important to question this assumption, since innovations can sometimes have also unintended and negative consequences. The history of capitalism is full of examples of innovations that have led to damaging effects on individuals, social groups, and/or the natural environment. In general terms, it is most often the case that innovations have positive effects for some and negative effects for others, but research has so far mostly focused on the former and neglected the latter. Investigating the dark sides of innovation means to study its unintended and negative consequences, alongside its positive effects.
This calls for new theoretical and empirical research in innovation studies, taking into account both positive and negative socio-economic effects of innovation, its bright and dark sides, and developing new conceptual and methodological tools to study, compare and assess multidimensional and contrasting effects of innovations in a broader interdisciplinary framework. This new departure will entail an in-depth discussion of how to value the societal effects of innovation, how to measure them, and how to assess their benefits and costs according to different social welfare functions. This is where innovation studies must cross-fertilize with, and draw inspiration from, other fields of research in which the social value of economic actions is explicitly investigated by means of social choice theories.
These questions do also have important implications in terms of R&D and innovation policy. Since innovations have complex and multi-dimensional effects – positive and negative; economic and non-economic – how can policy-makers assess and define whether a given innovation should be given public support, or instead regulated and limited? The multi-dimensional and complex nature of innovation presents policy-makers with a variety of trade-offs and complex choice sets, which call for the development of new tools of social choice analysis.

Please note: Minor changes to the schedule and/or topics may occur.
This course will look more closely at different aspects of how public research contributes to innovation and the broader societal impacts of investment in scientific knowledge. What do we mean when we talk about public research? How and why does it matter for innovation and impact in industry and in society? How can this be studies empirically? Is there a way to resolve the many contested issues emerging at the intersection between entrepreneurship, science and innovation policy?
Research and Innovation
In the late 1970s it became apparent that new high technology firms seemed to cluster around leading research universities such as MIT and Stanford in the US and Cambridge in the UK. Research in such organisations as well as in public labs seemed to be a major force in the electronics and ICT revolutions. Since then the interest in how research organisations contribute to innovation and other forms of societal impacts has exploded. Policymakers have pushed for increased commercialisation from science and improved linkages between universities and industry, and they have called upon public research to contribute to solving society’s grand challenges.
University-industry linkages
Although the interest in the utility of public science may be as old as science policy itself, the last decades represent a stronger belief in building a support structure around utility value and making this a more explicit demand to publicly funded research. Empirical investigations, particularly on academic entrepreneurship and university-industry linkages, have emerged hand in hand with the policy interests in these topics. The course aims to present and discuss literature from different conceptual traditions and with empirical data from different countries.

The field of innovation studies is typically based on the assumption that innovation is good for the economy, and that more innovations will lead to a wealthier and more sustainable economy and society. Since the 1980s, the underlying idea that has motivated the field is that innovation leads to positive economic effects, such as economic growth and employment creation, and does for this reason foster individuals’ welfare by leading to greater wealth.

More recent approaches, such as systemic and third generation mission-oriented innovation policy, are also implicitly based on the belief that innovations have the ability to address and solve grand societal challenges.
In spite of the importance and large consensus around the important positive effects of innovation, it is also worthwhile to consider that innovations can sometimes have unintended and negative consequences. The history of capitalism is full of examples of innovations that have led to damaging effects on individuals, social groups, and/or the natural environment. In general terms, it is most often the case that innovations and the process of “creative destruction” lead to positive effects for some and negative effects for others, although research has so far mostly focused on the former and often neglected the latter. Investigating the dark sides of innovation means to study its unintended and negative consequences, alongside its positive effects. In short, extant innovation research has adopted a narrow definition of social welfare, which focuses on positive economic performance and material well-being, and that mostly disregards the corresponding destruction effects, and therefore also distributional impacts of innovation.
This calls for new theoretical and empirical research in innovation studies, taking into account both positive and negative socio-economic effects of innovation, its bright and dark sides, and developing new conceptual and methodological tools to study, compare and assess multidimensional and contrasting effects of innovations in a broader interdisciplinary framework. This new departure will entail an in-depth discussion of how to value the societal effects of innovation, how to measure them, and how to assess their benefits and costs according to different ethical norms and theories of social justice. This is where innovation studies must cross-fertilize with, and draw inspiration from, other fields of research in which the social value of economic actions is explicitly investigated by means of social choice theories. Specifically, the course will provide insights from well-being studies and welfare economics, and show how these fields can enrich our understanding of the effects of innovation on social welfare.
The first part of this course will discuss the notion of individual well-being, and how different types of innovation affect this. The discussion will adopt a broad notion of agents’ well-being that comprises also non-economic factors and capabilities alongside income and material wealth. The second part of the course will shift the focus to the notion of aggregate social welfare, present different theories of social justice, and discuss how to take into account the distributional impacts of technological progress. This part will show that the impacts of innovation are characterized by complex trade-offs between efficiency and equity, both in the short- and in the long-run, which are often neglected in extant research. The third part of the course will analyze the implications of these for the rationale and foundations of R&D and innovation policy. Since innovations have complex and multi-dimensional effects – positive and negative; economic and non-economic – how can policy-makers assess and define whether a given innovation should be given public support, or instead regulated and limited? The multi-dimensional and complex nature of innovation presents policy-makers with a variety of trade-offs and complex choice sets, which call for the development of new tools of social choice analysis.

How do different religious traditions cope with diversity and pluralism, in their current theological reflection? And how can we understand the phenomenon of multiple religious belonging?
Searching for defining moments, the course will also discuss how memories of the past inform current encounters. Through an elective reading, the course will allow an in-depth contextual study of a particular aspect of interreligious relations (historical or current). Theoretically, the course will explore the scholarly field of interreligious studies.

insights to specific roles and impacts of religion in the migration context
the ability to see and interpret how migration also formats religion
knowledge on interpretations of contemporary citizenship theorisations in religion and migration contexts
competence in interpreting hospitalities and binaries, such as the host/guest and the victim/agent binary
understanding of some key theoretical developments in critical ways of approaching mobility across and beyond borders, and how these movements may be analysed from the perspectives of religion and citizenship

",,,"
Course content
Migration is a major topic of our time, both politically and ethically. Millions of people are passing borders, many of them as refugees, others for other reasons, causes and future prospects. Understanding migration requires the perspectives of different academic fields. In this context, migration is also a topic for theology and religion. Religion is shaped and reshaped by migration, as migration is shaped and reshaped by religion.
The aim of this course is to deepen and expand competence on the practice and content of religious and migration contexts. In many countries, religious organizations and projects contribute decisively to migration and refugee accommodation. From hospitable practices of meeting basic physiological needs to community building projects. How do the receivers contribute in shaping these practices? And furthermore, how do these practices impact religion? What can one learn from these practices, on the topics of hospitality, justice and contemporary citizenship?

Learning outcome
The student will acquire:

Advanced knowledge of sacred scriptures - their reception in various contexts and the various practices associated with them – with focus on the scriptural corpora of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
The ability to critically reflect on and discuss the complex roles that the sacred scriptures play within their respective traditions and in the interaction between them, as well as in relation to a wider, pluralistic, societal context.
The skill to identify and engage with common strategies for interpreting and “practicing” sacred texts, being sensible to the power dynamics involved.
The ability to discuss ethical challenges related to the reception of sacred texts in diverse religious contexts.
An appreciation for independent and critical reflection on the role of scriptural reception and practices in negotiating important aspects of religious diversity, such as the tension between conflict and coexistence.

",,,"
Course content
In this course, we will explore the dynamics between the corpora of texts that make up the sacred scriptures of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, their receptions through history and today, and the complex social practices that establish and confirm these texts as sacred. By highlighting the inner diversity of each of these scriptural traditions, we will shed light on the various roles that the scriptures, with their manifold textual and contextual aspects, play in the lives of religious communities and individuals. And – by focusing on the points of contact between the three traditions – we will examine the intersections, variations, parallels, contrasts and discrepancies between them. In accordance with the framework of the Religion and Diversity Master programme, we will consider how the various points of contact between the scriptures can represent both sources for conflict, and prospects for mutual understanding and fruitful coexistence.
Sacred scriptures are points of reference for individuals and communities and the different aspects of the roles they play in the lives of people and in societies may be perceived as either positive or negative. The scriptures are praised for promoting morals and guidance; providing insights for reflection and personal and social improvement; giving comfort in difficult times; helping people find meaning in life; and providing healthy societal structures for communities. At the same time, they are also criticized for promoting dangerous ideals and harmful practices; hindering social progress; giving a false sense of comfort or meaning; and causing social conflicts and wars. Within religious communities, the scriptures and their status as sacred are important for the formation of collective identities. As we will discuss during the course, however, the roles and meanings of the scriptures are constantly renegotiated and reinterpreted by both individuals and communities to form a complex matrix of identities and relationships.
This course will provide tools for understanding the many facets of the reception of sacred scriptures, and for engaging critically and constructively with the practices they generate. We will read a selection of passages from the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Qur’an and Talmud. Combining both historical and contemporary perspectives, we will study their historical origins in cultures that were very different from ours, as well as exploring moments in their reception through history to see how they are re-read and re-conceived in ever-new situations. We will consider different strategies for reading and “practicing” sacred scriptures and the ethical implications of such readings and practices. Motives and narratives shared across religious traditions and interreligious readings will be emphasized. The course aims to convey knowledge, skills, and attitudes that promote a perception of the study of sacred scriptures as a productive space for interreligious and intercultural exchange.

Course content
Religion and politics are often thought of as two fields of human activity, which are best kept separate in modern, liberal societies. Yet at the same time – for better or worse, to a greater or lesser extent – religion and politics interact extensively in the modern world. This course aims to explore those interactions.
We will begin on a conceptual level: What is politics? What is the function of politics? What types of political systems exist?
After addressing these questions, we will explore why and how religion is becoming increasingly relevant for politics and how religions can contribute to public debates. Religious interest groups and institutions may support specific policies, voice their positions in public debates, and seek to influence political decision-making processes.
At the same time, we will see that national politics can have a significant impact on the religious landscape of their country. We will study the “politics of religion” by addressing different cases and comparing the effect of different state-religion relationships.

Course content
Religious ritual such as prayer, worship, rites, and liturgy, is an essential part of the three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, both in their practice and their belief.
The course introduces the worship traditions of each of these religions as they appear in approximately the first millennium CE, with an emphasis on their historical evolution. The first part of the course is intended to give students a general knowledge of ritual and liturgical theory and terminology, as well as of the content of the three worship traditions.
During the second part of the course, we focus on selected themes in a comparative perspective. What comprises daily worship for Jews, Christians and Muslims during the first millennium CE? How are ordinary and extraordinary life events framed and affected by ritual practices?
Themes for analysis and discussion are ritual meals and the Eucharist, weekly and annual rituals and religious feasts and fasts, rituals that mark important life events and transitions, such as birth, death and initiation, rituals of purification, ritual efficacy and the relationship between ritual and materiality.
The relationship and mutual influences between the three worship traditions will be explored throughout the course, and there will be an emphasis on applying ritual and liturgical theory to the examples that we study.

Course content
This course is an opportunity for students to read and comment on hagiographical literature written on the lives of the saints and martyrs in the late antique period. The selected texts will be translations of materials in Greek and Coptic. This genre of literature was highly popular at a time when there was a significant growth in the cult of the saints and martyrs and pilgrimages to their associated shrines. In reading this hagiographical material we are given a glimpse into the lives of the people of the late antique period, their perception of the world and the place of Christian religious figures within it.
In this unit we shall focus on the creation, role and impact of such works in the late antique period. This shall involve the reading and analysis of translations of Greek and Coptic texts in order to contextualise it within a late antique Christian setting. A body of scholarly literature shall also be studied that shall be of use in evaluating the place of these texts within Graeco-Roman society.

Course content
What can objects, images and rituals tell us about religious practices and beliefs of the past? The theoretical framework of Material religion challenges the traditional supremacy of texts and acknowledges that religious meaning and personal piety was created, shaped, altered, and sustained through contact and engagement with material artefacts and places, and through performances. By engaging with a variety of materials and practices, the aim of the course is to broaden the perspectives on, and nuance traditional approaches to, medieval Christianity, in the East as well as in the West. Moreover, by showing how the study of images, relics, shrines, as well as rituals, performances, and text-bearing artifacts, such as books, rolls, ostraca, or amulets, are important to our understanding of how medieval Christians engaged with religious texts and objects, the course will demonstrate why studies based on texts alone cannot capture the full extent of medieval lived religion.
Through investigations of material artefacts and rituals, this course will provide the students with insight in medieval religious understandings and experiences. The aim of this course is to identify and elucidate religious beliefs and practices in the Middle Ages in harmony and in contrast to normative theological dogmas and institutional instructions.
The course is based on ongoing frontier research at the Faculty of Theology and offers insight into the most up-to-date research methods and debates. 
Throughout this course, students will be offered examinations of artefacts and rituals that in different ways are understood as instrumental for the medieval spirituality and religious understanding, The course is structured around six different categories of artefacts to be examined:

What is the relationship between religion and nature? What role can religious groups and leaders play in addressing climate change and other environmental challenges? And what are the various ways in which religions have responded to these challenges? What are the spiritual dimensions of activist groups engaged in environmental protection (e.g. Extinction Rebellion)?
In this course, we explore the intersections and entanglements of religion and ecology and invite students to critically reflect upon the role of religion in solving environmental challenges and deepening environmental concern. We will discuss how religion informs human relationships with nature and in what ways Western forms of Christianity may have contributed to our current environmental crisis. At the same time, we will explore how faith communities increasingly address environmental challenges and through which channels they facilitate (or prevent) transformative efforts toward more environmentally sustainable societies
In addition to focusing on traditional “world religions”, we will explore new forms of spirituality within environmental movements. Finally, the course discusses ritual, psychotechnic and spiritual responses to the ecological crisis (such as the performance of activist eco-liturgies) and the emergence of ecological movements that have responded by means of reclaiming Indigenous spiritualities in order to bring about global transformation.

The course has its focus on what we, based on art and archaeological remains, may learn about the development of Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, and Islam, especially in terms of their inter-relationship, from the first century to ca. 750 CE. In addition to an emphasis on social, religious, and political spatial settings, special attention is given to the role of sacred places in processes of identity formation and inter-religious relations.
Why Choose this Course?
The relevance of this course is seen both in recent developments in the academic study of inter-related religions and in increasing needs in modern societies - in which xenophobia, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are on the rise - for professionals educated in religious interaction and conflict resolution.
All of the traditions addressed in the course, Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, and Islam, construe key aspects of their religious identities based on historical claims and concepts that were formed in antiquity, and refer to such historical discourses when addressing contemporary issues involving both conflict and other forms of interaction. The study of the foundational periods of these religions is thus crucial both in terms of understanding modern society and with regard to the analytical skills needed to address issues of concern. Former US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has said: “In fact, if I went back to college today, I think I would probably major in comparative religion, because that’s how integrated [religion] is in everything that we are working on and deciding and thinking about in life today.” Considering the contemporary global influence of the so-called Abrahamic religions, not least in settings deeply entrenched in conflict and violence, interdisciplinary study of these traditions is more urgent than ever.
Space, Art, and Identity in Synagogue, Church, and Mosque will provide students with an education built on cutting-edge research, preparing them for active engagement with issues of crucial importance in the contemporary world.
The course is a cooperation between the University of Lund and University of Oslo, and held with lecturers from both universities.

Course content
Why do we see the rise of a new radical political right in Europe and the USA, with its ultra-nationalism, white supremacy ideals, attacks on liberal democracy and gender equality, and dreams of returning to a gated homeland and natural, ethnic religions? Are Aspirational Fascism or Culture Wars adequate terms for this occurrence? The course provides a conceptual basis for reflection on the emergence of both radical (activist) and extremist (violent) movements on the political right today and how certain religious ideologies and/or ritual imaginaries are used to mobilize individuals and groups. Democratic theories will be juxtaposed with religious thinking or ideologizing, including with representatives of Protestant theology, Christian nationalism, and neopagan Odinism. The political extremist Anders Behring Breivik's 22 July 2011 terrorist attacks on Oslo and Utøya, and the massive counter-response to his atrocities in the streets of Oslo, is the main case. The course will also explore the ritual imaginaries and competencies mobilized in these counter-responses.
Religion and democracy are historically ambivalent. While democracy includes a concept of people as 'demos' - a political and legal constitution of a people as citizens of a nation-state, traditional religion inherited a notion of people closer to 'ethnos' and the adjacent language of kinship, blood, and land. Ultranationalists draw inspiration from the past, from narratives of traditional religion and patriarchal culture, including from envisioned forms of historical Christianity. When they mobilize, ethnos is re-articulated. On the opposite end, we have globally inclusive counter-movements, such as Occupy, Black Lives Matter and Me-Too. Beginning in 2011, Occupy tried to reformulate radically inclusive forms of demos. They critiqued violence from the principle of pre-figurative politics, which assumes that how people organize (and ritualize) will determine the outcome of the expected results. Yet, the mobilization in the streets of Oslo - aimed at dissociation from Breivik - was not a political action but a spontaneous, ritualized form of collective protest, solidarity, and condolence. In this course, we will explore religion and politics in the contemporary West through these particular configurations.
Articles from the NFR funded research project REDO (Reassembling Democracy. Ritual as Cultural Resource 2013-2017), are included in the syllabus. They examine Breivik's anti-democratic ideology and killing acts, the ritual responses to his extreme violence, and how new social movements – such as Occupy – perform participatory democracy.

Learning outcome

To develop students’ critical understanding of the role and relevance of religion in contemporary society.
To provide students with an understanding of the relationship between religion and ecology and in what ways religions (including spirituality) are relevant for environmental challenges such as climate change.
To provide students with knowledge concerning the ways in which religious traditions can address environmental challenges and enable them to analyse this intersection along a theoretical framework.
To provide students with skills to critically reflect on the potentials of religion to facilitate (or prevent) transformative processes toward more environmentally sustainable societies.
To enable students with the skills to develop research questions in the academic field of climate change and religion and design a contribution to the field of religion and ecology.
Pertaining to general competencies, the course provides students with the ability to systematize knowledge, critically reflect on this knowledge, and practice oral summaries of knowledge.

Course content
What is the relationship between religion and nature? What role can religious groups and leaders play in addressing climate change and other environmental challenges? And what are the various ways in which religions have responded to these challenges? What are the spiritual dimensions of activist groups engaged in environmental protection (e.g. Extinction Rebellion)?
In this course, we explore the intersections and entanglements of religion and ecology and invite students to critically reflect upon the role of religion in solving environmental challenges and deepening environmental concern. We will discuss how religion informs human relationships with nature and in what ways Western forms of Christianity may have contributed to our current environmental crisis. At the same time, we will explore how faith communities increasingly address environmental challenges and through which channels they facilitate (or prevent) transformative efforts toward more environmentally sustainable societies
In addition to focusing on traditional “world religions”, we will explore new forms of spirituality within environmental movements. Finally, the course discusses ritual, psychotechnic and spiritual responses to the ecological crisis (such as the performance of activist eco-liturgies) and the emergence of ecological movements that have responded by means of reclaiming Indigenous spiritualities in order to bring about global transformation.
